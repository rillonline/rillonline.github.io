This has been difficult for me. I went down a number of alleys which did
not lead to joy. In the end, I decided on a very generic presentation so
that <code>ablog</code> works.
</p>

<p>
I decided on the generic approach for two reasons:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I got it working. I didn't want anything to break which led me
initially to despair and to work late.</li>
<li>My blog posts are more or less temporary. They may stay in the blog
repository, but I will be moving most of them to another repository
where they will be stored in writing collections. This means they
don't have to stay searchable and I don't expect my readers to have
to search through pages of archives to find them. The most likely
person to search is me.</li>
</ol>

<a href="https://ablog.readthedocs.io">ablog</a> is written in <code>python</code> so you
will need to have <code>pip</code> installed. I am using a <code>Debian</code> installation so
I had to install it manually. I already had
<a href="https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html">Jupyter Book</a> installed. This
means I already had <code>Sphinx</code> and the <code>myst-parser</code> installed. With
<a href="https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html">jb</a> installed, I was running
<code>Spinx 3.5.4</code> running, but was able subsequently to update both <code>Spinx</code>
and <code>myst-parser</code> to later versions. I think this helped me but I can't
say for sure. Your mileage may vary.
</p>

<p>
My install command is simple:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgc821cb5">
sudo pip3 install ablog
</pre>

<div id="outline-container-starting-ablog" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="starting-ablog"><span class="section-number-3">1.3.</span> Starting Ablog</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-starting-ablog">
<p>
I created a new repository on <a href="https://github.com">github</a> which I
cloned so basically I had a blank repository. Then I was able to set up
the initial framework for <a href="https://ablog.readthedocs.io">ablog</a>. This
is important because <a href="https://ablog.readthedocs.io">ablog</a> cannot be
installed in a directory with an existing conf.=py= file. ablog start
</p>

<p>
You will be prompted for several bits of information including where to
install <a href="https://ablog.readthedocs.io">ablog</a>. The directory must
exist. The other pieces of information will be written into your
conf.=py= file.

<div id="outline-container-restructured-text-or-markdown" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="restructured-text-or-markdown"><span class="section-number-3">1.4.</span> Restructured Text or Markdown?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-restructured-text-or-markdown">
<p>
The first decision you need to make is whether you want to write your
posts in Restructured Text (rst) (the language of Sphinx) or use
Markedly Structured Text
(<a href="https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/syntax.html">myst</a>).
Myst uses <code>.md</code> for files while Restructured Text uses <code>.rst</code>. You will
notice that <a href="https://ablog.readthedocs.io">ablog</a> uses <code>.rst</code>.
Fortunately, once you have Myst set up, you can use both.
</p>

<p>
If you already know markdown, you can get along fine with Myst. I became
familiar with Myst through <a href="https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html">jb</a>
and its a handy reference with its [Myst
<a href="https://jupyterbook.org/reference/cheatsheet.html">cheat sheet</a>.

<p>
You need to add myst_=parser= to the <code>extensions</code> variable in <code>conf.py</code>.
Remember, this is <code>python</code> so follow the format of the other extensions.
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org7d28af2">
extensions = [
    ...
    "myst_parser",
    ...
]
</pre>

<p>
<code>{tip} Be sure to notice the square brackets `[]`.</code>
</p>

<p>
You also need to add this statement. I put mine at the end of the
<code>conf.py</code> file:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org6ee8072">
myst_update_mathjax = False
</pre>

<p>
I also put this to enable additional features of <code>myst</code>.
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org373b5c3">
myst_enable_extensions = [
    "amsmath",
    "colon_fence",
    "deflist",
    "dollarmath",
    "html_admonition",
    "html_image",
    "linkify",
    "replacements",
    "smartquotes",
    "substitution",
    "tasklist",
]
</pre>

<p>
My previous tip about square brackets <code>[]</code> applies here, too.

<div id="outline-container-front-matter" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="front-matter"><span class="section-number-3">1.6.</span> Front Matter</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-front-matter">
<p>
Finally, each post needs front matter. I am using the <code>yml</code> format.
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org27017b5">
---
blogpost: true
date: August 15, 2021
category: Tech
---

Note particularly the three hyphens `-` on a separate line to
start and end the front matter. There are several other possible
pieces of information, but these are the most critical.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-the-index.rst-file">
<p>
I almost left the <code>index.rst</code> file alone. In my various iterations of
dealing with <a href="https://ablog.readthedocs.io">ablog</a> this gave me the
most trouble. That's why my blog page looks so generic and boring. It
just works.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I took out the references to <i>about me</i> because I reference that info
elsewhere.</li>

<li>I also deleted the file in the directory and the <code>index.rst</code> file.</li>

<h3 id="building-the-blog"><span class="section-number-3">1.8.</span> Building the Blog</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-building-the-blog">
<p>
To build the blog you simply type:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org1e7ae0d">
ablog build
</pre>

<p>
You will get a warning about <code>mathjax</code>. Review other warnings as needed.
Your new web site is in the <code>_website</code> directory.

<h3 id="cleaning"><span class="section-number-3">1.9.</span> Cleaning</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-cleaning">
<p>
I find it useful to delete the <code>_website</code> directory before a build.
<a href="https://ablog.readthedocs.io">ablog</a> has a command for this:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org7987654">
ablog clean

I use <code>ghp-import</code> to get my pages published. It's another <code>python</code>
program I learned about from <a href="https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html">jb</a>.
<a href="https://ablog.readthedocs.io">ablog</a> has its own <code>deploy</code> function
but I haven't checked that out yet. <code>ghp-import</code> only handles <code>gh-pages</code>
so I have to commit my own source files to
<a href="https://github.com">github</a> which is just fine with me for right now.

I was using <a href="https://getnikola.com/">nikola</a> to publish my blog. It's
fine, but it's heavier to use. There's a lot of flexibility and the
option of building pages, too. I just want a simple blog program and so
far, <a href="https://ablog.readthedocs.io">ablog</a> satisfies this requirement.
I need to learn more about the <code>.. toctree</code> directive in Sphinx to clean
up my landing page and add some more interesting elements to it.
