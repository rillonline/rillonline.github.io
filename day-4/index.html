  <p>When You Fast</p>

<p>Reading</p>

<p>Matthew 6:1-6 and 16-21</p>

<p>What does Jesus tell us about fasting?  The word &ldquo;reward&rdquo; in these texts is perhaps difficult for us, because along with &ldquo;reward&rdquo; we think of &ldquo;punishment.&rdquo;  I think a better choice of words here might be &ldquo;approval&rdquo;, that that might get at Jesus&rsquo;s intent better.  The hypocrites, the ones who feign piety, are trying to get other peoples&rsquo; approval.  That is why they want to look gaunt as if they are suffering.</p>

<p>Jesus tells us to seek God&rsquo;s approval, not to seek the approval of others. This means to do what is right, to do what is beneficial, both for our spiritual lives and to assist others.  That&rsquo;s the connection between fasting and the fruits of the spirit, as I see it.  If we live by the spirit, with love, joy, peace, patience, and the other fruits, we will fast from all those self-hyphenated activities which detract from our relationship with God and from our ability to live peaceably and well with each other.</p>

<p>When you fast, Jesus says, and it&rsquo;s not about food, though fasting from food may teach us things, when you fast, don&rsquo;t draw attention to yourself.  Let your works speak for you.  Let your acts of love and charity, let your prayer, let your attention to spiritual matters, speak for themselves.  God will see.  God will approve.  God will rejoice with you.</p>

<p>Let us pray&hellip;</p>

<p>O God, in this time of Lent, may my observance be about You and about other people, and not about self-aggrandizement.  Amen.</p>
