<p>Today we walked around the neighborhood. I totally missed Pine Street on the other side of 3rd. I will have to re-educate Elwood that this is not a pedestrian mall as I had originally indicated. I figured it out when we had walked too far and then came to North Main.
</p>
<p>We are still working on the park issue. At the curb is working best and will be more practical long term. We just couldn't practice at the Seeing Eye. It's the moves which we could have practiced along with the cars, stationary and otherwise, we we couldn't practice. Elwood is eating though I cut back his food since we are not on school schedule so sooner or later something has to happen.
</p>
<p>We went to the 5 o'clock service. Elwood thought it was quite peculiar that I wanted him to turn right after the building and didn't understand that the sidewalk with steps was his goal. I am teaching him to lay under the pew. Elwood was not thrilled about this. I spent a lot of the service putting him back in position. Fortunately, Episcopalians believe in assigned seats so I will be able to teach Elwood where to sit.</p>

<p>It has been a long day perhaps because we have been tied to each other.
</p>
<p>We have been out to breakfast, greeting old friends and learning how to behave when there is so much to sniff.
</p>
<p>We've been to the post office and walked around a little. We met our mobility instructor who said we looked good. Elwood had been laying down some paw and avoided the ramp at City Hall.
</p>
<p>Our greatest accomplishment was at park. We have found appropriate places and Elwood is relaxing enough to do what is necessary. It took 36 hours to get something to clean up. This is normal but nerve racking.
</p>
<p>Our biggest laugh was having me climb into the back of the truck for grocery shopping. It's a long way up and the seat is low inside so ballast is an issue. Being young and thin, Elwood bounds in and out. He did take a turn at the driver's seat. We laughed and laughed.
</p>
<p> Elwood also knows a few handy commands like ... inside. It means find your way into the building. For us, it means find the door to the apartment building from the street.</p>

<p>A long day ... up at 5:30. Left the Seeing Eye at 9. Flight delayed. Arrived Buffalo 2 pm. With collecting baggage, tending to Elwood's needs, a midafternoon meal, we got back to Jamestown at 5. Unpacked. Ate again. Out with Elwood twice. Getting into a routine is difficult. Writing on my desktop is also difficult. We're off to bed.</p>

<p>This morning the local students left. They are driven home by an instructor who does some work with them around home. We had to say good-bye to one of our classmates. Our class list has names and addresses but not phone numbers. I asked if she could take down my number. She said her equipment was packed. Then I had an idea--I went to the map room where there is a braille machine and wrote down my numbers.
</p>
<p>This morning we went to the hospital. Elwood was indifferent to the hospital personnel and equipment he saw. Our greatest excitement was the electronic revolving door.
</p>
<p>I am mostly packed. What is left I am still using.
</p>
<p>It's raining and I'm wearing my crocks which means the rain can come through the holes. My sneakers are almost dry, sitting on the window sill.
</p>
<p>This afternoon we will take the bus.
</p>
<p>This brings me to going home. Here are some things to remember.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Elwood is a new, young dog. Caitlin was older and seasoned.</li>
<li>Do not compare these dogs. They are both labs but the similarity ends there.</li>
<li>Elwood will make mistakes. He has never been in Jamestown or any place else I've been already.</li>
<li>
<strong>Do not pet the dog!</strong> Elwood and I need to develop good working habits. What we do in this first month will be with us forever!</li>
<li>I will be tied to Elwood for at least two weeks. No one else can take him anywhere. We willl be establishing our patterns and his park schedule.</li>
<li>Elwood has a lot to live up to and some specific skills to develop. We will be spending a lot of time working on his behavior at home and away. For example, Elwood will learn  how to lay quietly unsupervised during the anointing and sharing of the peace at the Thursday morning healing service. He doesn't know how to do this now but he can sit in his place and wait for his dinner to arrive. it's amazing.</li>
<li>Although you are all special people, I am the only one special to Elwood for the next 6-12 months. That's how long it will take to adjust to one another.</li>
<li>Remember, Elwood has not lived in a household situation since May. He will have to relearn this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Elwood was very curious this morning. I packed his mut mat in my suitcase. I think that caused more sniffing than the 8-pound bag of food.</p>

<p>Sunday was a busy day though no trips are scheduled. Several of us went out on the leisure path in the morning. I went twice around--2/3 of a mile.
</p>
<p>Gail and Pete came. We went out on the leisure path and did a turn, then came inside. When the lounge got crowded, we went back outside. Very mild weather here and there was a bench in the sun. Pete passed on another turn round the path, but Gail and I persevered.
</p>
<p>After supper, I went for a night walk in Morristown. Elwood has never worked at night and sometimes I walk in the dark, especially in winter. He did great. I even had the sense I knew where I was since we traveled on the same streets but in a different configuration.
</p>
<p>I had a chance to ride in a mini van and review dog-in-car. With air bags, it will be important for Elwood to lay down while traveling. It is being recommended that traveling longer distances in a crate is helpful. All the puppies have been crate trained.
</p>
<p>This morning we were awakened to Garth Brooks and "Low Places". walked around the courthouse. We got to go through two metal detectors which was the real point of the exercise as well as working through some groups of people.
</p>
<p>Elwood went to the vet because of a bump near his eye. It's being analyzed, but the vet thinks it is a pimple. I guess when you're a teenager, you get acne even if you are a dog! Actually, they are calling it a whitehead.
</p>
<p>We went through a revolving door, walked inbetween two men having a heated discussion about football and that was Monday so far as trips go.
</p>
<p>In the evening we had a long lecture. One of the instructors was giving us some history. <q>I can't remember our founder's first husband's name,</q> she said. <q>All I can remember is his last name: Wood.</q> <q>It was L.</q> I said. <q>Oh,</q> she said, <q>L-Wood?</q> The class broke up. The instructor took a while to get it. As it turns out, the man's name was Walter Woods.
</p>
<p>Tuesday was a zoo. First, we had to put the dogs' booties on for a walk in style.. Then we went to the coffee shop--two drinking coffee while the other one worked. I was last to work. Elwood had been good--because he was busy chewing a hole in one of his booties. He did great work in one of the stores with tight clearances.
</p>
<p>I met a woman on the street who asked how I knew she was there. I didn't--just that Elwood was sniffing something.
</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I had my exit interview with the president, went to the vet to hear about Elwood's health history and our class went for ice cream Sundaes.
</p>
<p>Our instructor thought it would be good to do some sedan work. We had one person and one dog in front, a second dog and person in the back and I was also to get into the back seat with Elwood. I got in. Elwood got in. The dog already there thought it was a bit tight and growled. The instructor decided to <q>spin</q> Elwood around, which meant Elwood was on my lap while spinning. However, he didn't quite fit because when we closed the door, he jumped onto my lap. We got in the van to go to town.
</p>
<p>When we went for ice cream, I went outside but didn't know where the van was. Another classmate joined us. A classmate in the van called to us. <q>Oh, no,</q> I thought. <q>She's driving!</q>
</p>
<p>Today the local students go home. An instructor drives them and settles them in. We are all frantically figuring out how to get everything in our suitcases including 8 pounds of dog food.
</p>
<p>Last night at park two of us stepped in our dog's output. We were instructed to come to the wall and hold up our shoes for inspection. <q>not like that,</q> the instructor said. <q>Like a horse.</q> He untied our offending shoes and left us there, one shoe off, one shoe on, holding onto the wall. He was gone a long time. Water wasn't enough to get my shoe clean. It is still quite wet. Fortunately, I have another pair of shoes!</p>

<p>Yesterday we had a <q>Meet and Greet</q> exercise whereby some of the instructors came up to shake my hand and Elwood had to remain sitting.
</p>
<p><q>Is this a wedding with the mother of the bride?</q> one of the instructors asked.
</p>
<p><q>Sunday morning worship,</q> I replied.
</p>
<p>He came, sobbing, saying <q>A wonderful sermon.</q>
</p>
<p>He greeted another student, thanking her for such a lovely wedding, then he came back to me, shaking my hand, telling me what a wonderful sermon for the funeral. The task was serious, the play acting hysterically funny.
</p>
<p>We shopped at a pet store and went to Wall-Mart for our afternoon outing. One of the dogs jumped up on the counter when his person was checking out.
  </p>
<p>This morning we did some country-style work in a subdivision--walking along people's front yards, around parked cars, onto short pieces of sidewalk, lining myself up to cross a street.
</p>
<p>Afterwards, we went to an A&amp;P to practice shopping cart work. We've been doing it right, shoppers, guide in front of the basket, person and dog behind. Elwood left the bread and the meaqt alone.
</p>
<p>Clerks crack me up. They are giving you instructions with the debit card because you're blind and then keep saying, <q>Now press the green button.</q>
</p>
<p>I was able to get my wash done--not a lot to do because of the early instances of emergency washes.
</p>
<p>Lunch was a cafateria line with a tray and silverware wrapped in napkins. Our sandwiches and dessert were wrapped in foil, our macaroni salad in a cup with a lid and our soup in a double coffee cup with a lid. Then we worked our dogs to our tables while carrying the tray against our bodies. I said to our server, who also does housekeeping, <q>You must hate it--all this trash to pick up.</q> She replied, <q>I don't hate. I can handle it once a month.</q> Drinks were served at the table.
</p>
<p>This afternoon we practiced in the airline
 seats provided by Continental. These were first class seats though with lots of room for dogs, even in the bulk heads. 
</p>
<p>We read our puppy profiles. Elwood was raised by a veteran puppy raiser--an older couple with grandchildren who came to visit. Some reports have lots of information. Sadly, neither of my puppy reports have been too detailed. My instructor said the training report she gets was not particularly detailed either.
</p>
<p>We changed tables again at supper for the rest of the time here. I don't handle this well. This table will take some getting used to. I tire of the cross examinations. Just let me be!
</p>
<p>This evening we learned how to massage our dogs. Elwood wasn't sure about this at first. He mellowed over time. We listened to this album: <a href="http://www.napster.com/player/tracks/14164011" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.napster.com/images/buttons/btn_play.gif" border="0">A Gathering

<p>Today we go to the train and return on the bus. It is very cold. We were awakened at 5:30 by Elvis and an announcement that it was 17 degrees out--and blowing. Park was better this morning: no wet shoes, no wet jeans, poop in a straight line. 
</p>
<p>Yesterday we did some country work, walking on a road without sidewalks. More trouble than it's worth! Our second trip was back on South Street, into stores, walking on the Green in the center of town. The graduates who live in town don't walk on the Green because it is impossible to judge the traffic and use the traffic islands to get there.
</p>
<p>Our Elm Street solo went fine. I partnered with another woman who found memorizing the route and the traffic overwhelming. She lives in the country. We had to work around a construction site--an unplanned barrier. I realized how strange it is to hear construction since there is not a lot of it in Jamestown. I think the day laborers were talking about us. I think I heard the word <em>perror</em> as I passed. Later in the trip, there was a dog guide backup at the planned barrier. We were 4 of 4. Elwood didn't even bother to go up to the barrier. he just made the turn. We had to wait for traffic to step out into the road. In the afternoon, we rode escalators and elevators in a department store.
 </p>
<p>At my final massage session, the woman said everyone told her they were tired. She was doing a lot with leg muscles. I learned that although my knees ached, it is probably the thigh muscles which ache.
</p>
<p>Elwood is being very stupid about going to his mat. He is very clear about staying there while I bring the food. In the afternoon, we have to tell them to stay put while we fix dinner. He is very clear about what gets dinner there fast--or he thinks he's tied up--I don't know which yet.
</p>
<p>I managed to tie him up in the flixline--25 feet of tape measure. It reminded me of the time I got Caitlin wrapped up in a microphone wire during worship.
</p>
<p>Later ...
</p>
<p>The train was late so we took it both ways and will leave the bus to another day. It was very cold waiting on the platform. Elwood has been taught to avoid the edge of the platform when there is no train. A forward command from several feet away causes him to immediately turn left or right. We needed to use the stairs both ways to get on and off the train.When we got back, Elwood stopped at a very high curb. He refused to go off of it. Who knows! It might have been a platform. Hey, he was at a train station. Finally, we got him into the parking lot.
</p>
<p>Train station: Elwood 100%, Merrill, about an 82. Platforms make me nervous though I traveled NJ Transit and Septa 7 to and from LTSP for a semester.

<p>Yesterday: a second go-round of the Elm Street route. There's a ditty for the street names. I'll capitalize the street names:
</p>
<blockquote>
The King of Pine Wil not [Mont] Spring over Dumont to South.
</blockquote>
<p>Pine--we cross it twice, has a light and so does Spring. It'sw 1.5 miles long so we walked 3 miles yesterday.
</p>
<p>When we got back, my neighbor stopped by. We are still tied to our dogs. Her dog proceeded to urinate on the floor, soaking my bedspread and coat. Housekeeping was alerted about the spread. I went off to the laundry room.
I fell asleep so didn't get the coat dried before afternoon park. I used my polartek vest which was enough. On my way to the laundry downstairs, I ran into (literally) the Seeing Eye president and his dog. He apologized for interfering with my exit to park. <q>We're on our way back,</q> I told him. <q>Our shoes are safe.</q> For evening park, I couldn't locate my gloves. I have since found them.
</p>
<p>Elwood is a trial at park. I wash my shoes regularly. The instructors are starting to laugh at me. I'm always jumping back from him while I'm trying to unharness him. He also walks when he poops. I am usually standing in the middle of a circle by the time he's done. The trick will be to stop him from walking while not stopping him from pooping.
</p>
<p>We're off for another turn around the block, so to speak.</p>

<p>We started to learn the Elm Street route. It is basically pie-shaped with the north side of South Street forming the crust of the pie. Elm Street forms one side of the slice and five streets:
</p>
<ol>
<li>King</li>
<li>Pine</li>
<li>Wilmont</li>
<li>Spring</li>
<li>Dumont</li>
</ol>
are on the other side.
<p>It's cold and windy today. We passed day laborers looking for work. They must be very cold as their streets were shady and the wind was blowing. I was there about 8:30 a.m. Have they been standing around since 3 or 4 a.m.?
</p>
<p>Elwood has some do-overs--a dog distraction and a barrier of the construction tape across the sidewalk variety. We are learning how to work together. Elwood is sensitive and needs support to assertively push me if he needs to go around an obstacle. I need to help him to gain confidence to do this. 
</p>
<p>We also had a traffic check--the class supervisor drove a van toward us, causing Elwood to back up. I need to learn how to back up with him. These are staged and I know they are coming.  they are carried out on the streets and in driveways.
</p>
<p>The cars and vans the staff drive have the Seeing Eye logo on them. Sometimes they get stopped by the public, wondering why they are trying to run over the people with dogs. They have to explain what they are doing. Once when an instructor was working with someone without a dog but with the harness, someone came up to the instructor and said, k, <q>Didn't they used to have dogs doing this? Have you replaced them with human beings?</q></p>
