<p>
***Narrative
</p>

<p>
You can skip this part if you only want to know how to get sending mail
working on your pi.
</p>

<p>
There was a person who contributed to Hacker Public News (I think they
used a fictional character's name) who once wrote that all instructions
on the Internet had incorrector missing information in their tutorials.
I certainly have found this to be true in this extended saga.
</p>

<p>
In my physical space, I have a pi at a computer stand on one side of the
room and a ChromeBook on the other. I did a lot of walking back and
forth. I use the ChromeBook to search the Internet and copy items of
interest. Now when I search, I always get an AI overview. In general, I
find these overviews to give me the information I need, but not this
time. The information was often outdated or incorrect.
</p>

<p>
I have also come to the conclusion that pages on the ArchLinux wiki do
not first give you the basics but are delighted to give you lots of
other things you can do without stressing what you actually need to get
up and running.
</p>

<p>
Finally, it often takes me a while to realize what part of the examples
are required text and which are placeholders.
</p>

<p>
Take for example the line:
</p>

<p>
<code>account gmail</code>
</p>

<p>
In this case, <code>gmail</code> is an arbitrary name. I could put <code>squirrel</code> or
<code>arugala</code> even when I am defining a <code>gmail</code> account.
</p>

<p>
I have spent days searching, installing, uninstalling and puzzling over
errors. Rince and repeat.
</p>

<p>
OK, on to the way to get it working.
</p>

<p>
***Introduction
</p>

<p>
I wanted a way to move some files off of my raspberry pi onto cloud services like OneDrive and Dropbox. Instead of configuring <code>rclone</code> or a similar service, I figured an email attachment would work just as well. (I totally forgot I could copy files to my PC with <code>scp</code>.) I wanted something quickly and not necessarily elegantly to get the job done.
</p>

<p>
***Installation
</p>

<p>
You need to install three programs:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>msmtp</li>

<li>msmtp-mta</li>

<li><p>
s-nail
</p>

<p>
<code>sudo pacman -S msmtp mstp-mta s-nail</code>
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
That's it! Nothing from the <code>aur</code>.
</p>

<p>
Two caviots here:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If you are using <code>gmail</code> to send your messages, you will have to create an app password for your account. Your regular password will not work.</li>

<li>I did not hide this app password in a key ring. I learned the default program <code>secret-tool</code> requires that a desktop needs to be installed. I didn't want to use <code>gpg</code> or a password manager. Is someone really going to break into my house or network and interrogate my raspberry pi to get into my <code>gmail</code>?</li>
</ol>

<p>
***The .mailrc file
</p>

<p>
Create a file named .mailrc.Include this line:
</p>

<p>
<code>set mta</code>"/usr/bin/msmtp"=
</p>

<p>
***Configure MSMTP
</p>

<p>
Create a file called <code>.msmtprc</code>.Here is the configuration file that finally worked for me. 
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgd453b9b">
auth on
tls on
tls_starttls on
tls_certcheck on
logfile ~/.msmtp.log
host smtp.gmail.com
port 587
from your-email-address
user your-email-address
password your-app-password
</pre>

<p>
This is the barebones I could get away with.
</p>

<p>
***Change File Permissions
</p>

<p>
You must change permissions on the <code>.msmtp</code> file if it contains a
password.
</p>

<p>
<code>sudo chmod 600 .msmtprc</code>
</p>

<p>
***Sending a Message
</p>

<p>
To test this configuration, I used the following command. I sent the
message to a different email account from the one I configured in <code>.msmtprc</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>echo ‚ÄúThis is only a test.‚Äù | mail -s ‚ÄúTest Message" -a sending-mail.md receiving-msg-account</code>
</p>

<p>
This is one line and includes attaching this file to the email.

I've been using text mode to write these blog entries. Additionally, I
have been using <a href="http://www.daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> to format
them. As I do not have markdown enabled yet in emacspeak and because I
am unable to install pandoc on the pi, I've been copying them to my
Vinux machine for processing and posting.
</p>

<p>
I've discovered how to create a web page and convert it to html. This
post is a test case. 
</p>

<h2 id="org5a773d6"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Some Confusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
In reading Alex's <a href="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/info/html/tutorial.html">explanation</a>, I was confused because he talks about creating a web page. This <code>page</code>  is not something which is published on the web. It is a file a browser can read and interpret. What Alex has you do is write a file that acts as a list of bookmarks to your favorite sites so you can launch it and get around the web quickly and easily. After I understood this, his explanations made a lot more sense.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> The extension <code>.org</code> refers to org mode not the domain type as in <code>raspberryvi.org</code>. This also confused me. I thought at first org mode was not installed, but that is because I was hearing <code>aug</code> mode as in <code>augmented</code>
or <code>August</code>. It's <code>org</code> as in <code>organized</code>.

<p>
Sadly, my menu structure is different from the one described so I'm reading the <a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/index.html">Org Manual</a>. 
</p>

<p>
One of the exciting discoveries I've made says You can publish this file and there will be navigation as part of the publishing process. I'm currently reading the manual and each section of the book is a separate page with navigation to other sections built in.
</p>

<p>
I've looked at the html code generated and it is overly fussy. I'll try it with tidy and see what happens. s the code is correct, tidy has no effect. 
</p>

<p>
I'm publishing the full html that was generated including the preamble and postamble. I am not sure how to disable this.

I'm waiting for my parts list so that my Raspberry Pie can be built.
Meanwhile, my USB hub and keyboard come today according to UPS.
</p>

<p>
I talked with Mike on Mangler.I now understand Raspberrian is a distro
for the pie based on Debian. It has a graphical user interface which
doesn't curently speak. I'm interested in the console and excited to
think my skills in the console will be improved if I work steadily in
Pie Land.
</p>

<p>
I'd be much happier working on my console skills than learning
emacspeak. I've done a little work with Vim and Nano and I like the
Alpine email client. I have even used Lynx to download books from the
NLS site. Mike is working on a new build so maybe the instabilities he
has noticed will be less of a factor. I hope so.
