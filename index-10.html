<p>The movers finally arrive after 5 o'clock Saturday and were very tired. Apparently their last pickup thought they would pack everything and was totally unpacked. Of course, they hadn't contracted for this. I understand they moved everything out, but left a few hinges behind. Fortunately, they will be mailed. They did, however, litter which I will report.</p>
<p>My daughter-in-law arrived at work after vacation to discover her boss thought she would be out today and scheduled a meeting for all day tomorrow when we planned to sign the lease. I have emailed the apartment and I hope Wednesday will be okay.</p>
<p>Not n knowing when the stuff will arrive here in Wisconsin is frustrating and a big unsettling. Also missing my daughter-i-law's emails because I have the mesage notification turned off makes me feel a bit incompetent. I am, however, moving forward with some more moving details. All in good time. An interstate move seems very complicated this time though I've done it before. I think it is because I am not closely associated with my things. Maybe life gets more complicated.</p>
<p>Yesterday Melanie's family came for dinner and that was pleasant. J. and I had coffee together at a shop with outdoor tables. I'm also checking into the new desktop computer so that I can check in with Bible study from time to time.    </p>

<p>Elwood was still on eastern time this morning. Now that he and I know where his relief area is, this will work well. We took a long walk with J. and Melanie to a local coffee shop where we had lunch outside. Milwaukee prices are very different from Jamestown prices. Next we went to Trader Joe's and to Walgreens. A several mile walk in gorgeous weather. I got a sunburn. Elwood got a workout with many street crossings. He handled everything with aplomb. </p>
<p>I learned rice noodles have 56 carbs per quarter cup serving. I won't be eating them again very soon.</p>
<p>After numerous phone calls from the driver, my mover arrived at 5:10 p.m. today. It will be longer before my stuff arrives in madison as I had been told. I'm working at making myself scarce around the apartment. </p>
<p>Elwood is settling in well and getting used to these new arrangements quickly which is a relief. I'm even figuring out the new place.</p>
<p>I'll go Tuesday to sign the lease and see my new digs for the first time. This will help to know what I need to get.</p>
<p>The kids helped me pick out a new table, chairs, and computer station. It's a very different style from what I have had before. The chairs, for example, are black microfiber with chrome legs and a lighter wood top on the table with a white computer desk with metal foil. Melanie also found a small cabinet with two drawers in scratch and dent since the computer table has only shelving. We picked up a keyboard shelf to add to it. I'm trying to do simple lines and a new look. </p>

<p>Today Elwood and I set off for the two-block walk to the Post Office. I have found our city Post office to be a peculiar building, but then, maybe every Post Office is peculiar. There was the little building behind Musclemann's store where Mrs. perdom weighed our 4-H rabbits for my sister and me. We brought them in our doll carriage, the only conveyance we had available to us which would contain the rabbits. A wagon would not have worked.</p>
<p>I think the Jamestown Post Office is far grander and therefore far less functional. Two sets of multiple doors must be negotiated before tramping up the stairs into the rotunda. Perhaps some nineteenth-century charm might have been retained to recall a time when public buildings evoked a sense of stability and making a mark on the land. CNN destroys any atmosphere the space may have had not to mention messing with the acoustics.</p>
<p>Upon leaving the staircases, Elwood became a tourist.    What is this place? He stopped listening to my directions, gazing about. Surely we had been here before. With friends and the convenience of buying stamps at the grocery store not to mention automatic payment, I do not come here frequently. </p>
<p>Fortunately,, the postal clerk sang out and I transacted my business; then we were off for our daily walk in the sunshine.</p>
<p>Crossing Harrison Street seemed to present a challenge to Elwood. I became concerned. When Elwood is uncertain, he does everything in slow motion. I kept encouraging him to hurry before the light changed. After what seemed an eternity, we stepped up onto the curb having overshot the ramp. No wonder the trip seemed endless. We had walked much farther.</p>
<p>Elwood suggested we continue to Five Corners, but I insisted we turn around and find the sidewalk to Tim Horton's. Then Elwood's difficulty presented itself to me. There was a tape across the sidewalk.</p>
<p>A man in the first car waiting for the light explained I could go around on the grass and directed me. I discovered there were evergreens growing where I thought there was just scraggly grass. We reached sidewalk again and made our way to Tim Horton's. I congratulated Elwood on his terrific work.</p>
<p>here's the thing: I am not persuaded God needs to be importuned for parking spaces. However, I did ask for assistance getting back across harrison Street. What was I supposed to do? Go back by the evergreens and step off the sidewalk and stand in the street where I thought the intersection might be?</p>
<p>We set out boldly, Elwood navigating the drive through and its cars and locating the sidewalk on the other side of the entrance. Maybe the tape wasn't at the ramp. Elwood turned right and stood at the curb, far short of where I judged the ramp to be. A tape angled across the sidewalk.</p>
<p>"The sidewalk's not there," a voice said. "You can cross. The light is red."</p>
<p>Oh dear. Red light intelligence again. For whom is the light red? Me? The cars in front of me? They were whizzing past.</p>
<p>"Want to hold onto my bike?"</p>
<p>My hand was placed on a bicycle seat. Bicyclist, Elwood and I crossed the street together.</p>
<p>I'm a country girl. I lived far beyond the sidewalk growing up. However, I also had shoulders, grassy banks  and ditches to keep me off the road. I will have to wait for news of sidewalk rehabilitation before chancing another Harrison Street crossing. Sigh. So much for practice crossing busy streets and an outing for coffee.</p>

<p>We certainly are enjoying the warmer weather and dry sidewalks here in jamestown. Elwood and I have done our River Walk route and are starting to walk down 3rd Street for exercise. We found that the crossing at Washington is clear.</p>
<p>We went down that way when the circus was in town. Elwood was acting very strange, not focused on what I wanted him to do but investigating other people and looking around. It seems he was smelling elephants.</p>

<p>Elwood and I were invited to Easter dinner. Elwood was additionally invited to be loose in the house. He immediately began to rush about, upstairs and down, investigating everything. The appetizers on the coffee table created some excitement. Bouncing on and off people's laps created a stirr. The biggest excitement though was when he discovered the Easter ham on the sideboard. He was apprehended with his nose a quarter of an inch from the ham. </p>
<p>A cookbook which had caused some excitement among friends this Lent is entitled What Jesus Would Eat. One of the dishes for our Easter dinner came from that book: couscous and apricots. It sounded quite fancy to me, but if Elwood had gotten the ham, we would have been eating much more like Jesus: green beans and couscous. </p>

<p>Elwoodhas been suffering from cabin fever. First, it was snowing all the time and I was uncertain    even where the sidewalk was. Second, it got very, very cold and windy and I thought it was too cold to be out for long. Elwood doesn't like the cold. It is like being with a little kid. "I want to go out! I want to go out!" So you bundle them all up. It takes forever. Five minutes later they're back in the house. "I'm cold." And then it takes forever to get them out of everything. That is how Elwood is. He feels the cold.</p>
<p>Then, I started fighting off whatever is going 'round and I've felt very, very tired. And of course, guilty, that Elwood isn't getting exercise. niether am I for that matter. </p>
<p>We were at church, at the healing service. Elwood pushed in front of me at the rail. I said, "Elwood has a prayer request. He wants to go for a walk." Someone further down the line said, "I'm running errands at lunchtime. I'll be by for him. Ask and ye shall receive."</p>
<p>So Elwood went out--sniffing all the way. He visited at the thrift shop. He went to his friend's house. He visited the park. I've never been to some of these places.</p>
<p>Today it was bright and sunny. Although it hasn't been especially warm, the solar gain has been such that a lot of snow has melted. We went for our walk. The only tricky part was the viaduct. There are still some very icy patches and I hit one. The river walk is almost clear except for the shadiest section. The river is quite noisy so the water level must be high or there are lots of objects in the river for the water to spill over and around. Elwood was pleased with our outing.  </p>
