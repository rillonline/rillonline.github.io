  <h2>#About Star Runner</h2>

<p>Star Runner is an unfinished novel I began back in early 2007. Over the intervening years I have edited and re-edited the first chapter. But all my attempts to both finish the novel and tame it into a believable story have failed.</p>

<p>This might be a recipe for disaster, but other novels have emerged during National Novel Writing Month. I have not wanted to “publish” (and I use this verb very loosely) these books because the beginning story is not finished.</p>

<p>One of the ideas I have entertained over the past couple of years is to turn Star Runner’s introduction into a shorter work, a novel, a novelette or even a short story. I haven’t made any progress here either.</p>

<h3>Alternative Scenario</h3>

<p>Alternatively, I have introduced other recurring characters in the Star Runner universe. One of these is Ronnie Camberwell. I have written several first draft novels where she is the primary character. From time to time Star Runner appears. I could work on these stories and leave Star Runner as a supporting actor, putting off those novels where Star Runner carries the action.</p>

<h3>Thoughts for the Future</h3>

<p>I really want to make some forward progress this year with my fiction writing. I like to think of myself as a writer, but if I don’t have anything suitable for publication, even as an ebook for free download, I may have to abandon the whole idea of being a writer.</p>

<h3>Support</h3>

<p>Of course there is the matter of support. I haven’t found a writer’s group, some firs readers or dare I say it, an editor. Knowing someone I can hire may move this project forward during this upcoming year.</p>
