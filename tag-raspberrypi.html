<p>
I'm waiting for my parts list so that my Raspberry Pie can be built.
Meanwhile, my USB hub and keyboard come today according to UPS.
</p>

<p>
I talked with Mike on Mangler.I now understand Raspberrian is a distro
for the pie based on Debian. It has a graphical user interface which
doesn't curently speak. I'm interested in the console and excited to
think my skills in the console will be improved if I work steadily in
Pie Land.
</p>

<p>
I'd be much happier working on my console skills than learning
emacspeak. I've done a little work with Vim and Nano and I like the
Alpine email client. I have even used Lynx to download books from the
NLS site. Mike is working on a new build so maybe the instabilities he
has noticed will be less of a factor. I hope so.
