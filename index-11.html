<p>Something is fishy in the charges for my move. According to the moving service, I moved 5,800 pounds. Not a chance. The money owed may or may not be correct, but certainly relates not at all to the poundage reported. The solution is to pay and go with the truck to a weigh station. Much inconvenience and irritation. Waste of time and gas, but necessary, I think, to avoid being scammed. According to the office, they loaded the truck 7/09. Try 06/28. Melanie suggested they are reading the wrong ticket. I hope it is that. I asked the coordinator via email to re-confirm info. Waiting for a response. If this does not come by afternoon, I'll call. irritating enough. Time to move on as my guest status has gotten old for everyone.</p>
<p>Today is melanie's birthday. I'm trying to figure out how to make this nice for her. I'm really limited here.</p>
<p>In addition, it is the anniversary of Caitlin's death which i still take very hard. </p>
<p>I have my screen reader working better. There was a problem in the code. I knew that, but proving it was difficult. We're so responsive, blah. blah. blah. Well, only on the easy problems. It's scary when the programmer googles your problem before downloading debugging software to your computer remotely. However, this is probably the way tech will be handled in the main stream from here on out. </p>
<p>Elwood is missing his time outside and walking. It is getting hot today. It was cool yesterday.</p>
<p>The good news is, that however the details shake out, I'll be in Madison this weekend.</p>

<p>Still waiting around to hear about the arrival of the moving truck. Well, experience is handy in these things. Fortunately, I have a place to hang. We even had leftovers last night.</p>
<p>I have learned that the local co-op in Madison delivers to my area and I've had fun reading about all the products I can order. Figuring out poundage as opposed to pieces of fruit will be an adventure. You can also order glass jars and bottles for your stuff to be delivered in if you want to avoid plastic. Meat is pricey because it is organic or free range but then we're all supposed to eat less meat and this is certainly an incentive. I was pleased to discover they have a specific link to Wisconsin cheeses. I could dump most meat for cheese anyway. The coop is full service so there's paper towels, toilet paper and light bulbs, too. Unfortunately, it's a different kind of pet food. There're cleaners in bulk, too. Definitely  not glass there for me. I remember the days when shampoo came in glass containers. Not good. </p>
<p>Yesterday we had a nasty thunderstorm. There was one thunderclap which sounded directly overhead. I asked Elwood if he was scared. He was scared that I wasn't handling thunderstorms well. I don't like loud sounds nearby. My dogs have always handled them better than me. </p>
<p>I've also been looking for a new computer on line. It looks like I will invest in a mini notebook or what some are calling netbooks. </p>
<p>Last night J. asked that we continue listening to a podcast audio drama in the Star Trek universe. I had to download it and melanie took Elwood outside. Fortunately, she noticed he had brought his bone with him and that he had dropped his other bone outside. It would have been very sad to lose bones. Elwood is enjoying chewing on his new bone. I had not realized there are chew areas and when they're all chewed up, it's time for a new bone. 
I've been looking on line for a few things I didn't bring with me, like a vacuum cleaner because mine was overheating.</p>

<p>There's been some trouble with LiveJournal: people not being able to leave comments or read more recent posts. I do not think the problem is how this particular journal is set up. I hope the problems sort themselves out.</p>
<p>On the 4th melanie and J. went to a picnic. It gave me the chance to do some laundry and chill. I thought it would be a long day and I did not want to expose Elwood to fireworks.</p>
<p>Saturday patience, Melanie and I went shopping in Racine. We have never done anything like this before.</p>
<p>Sunday we went to church. I was told it was the most boring sermon ever. I don't think this is true. It was, however, two sermons in one and not very uplifting. The liturgical music was also very saccharine, including rewriting I heard the Voice of Jesus Say. Yuck. Elwood, like some of the parishioners, went to sleep. Fortunately, he did not snore like the person behind us. </p>
<p>Afterward, J. and I went for coffee. The fancy drinks must be loaded with sugar and heavy cream. J. had something very tasty, very cold and with unusual seasonings like cardamom. I am sticking to coffee with cream.</p>
<p>The kids took a nap in the afternoon. I washed frying pans.</p>
<p>I bought fruits and vegetables at the local co-op. I wish there is something so near in Madison. I did balk at cherries for $8.99 a pound. Wisconsin milk prices are supposed to be the highest in the country.</p>
<p>Today I read that Dane County, where Madison is, has air pollution above federal requirements. Will I ever get beyond air pollution?</p>
<p>Thunderstorms today. Very humid.     </p>

<p>Melanie and I went to Madison yesterday on the interstate. We passed the area that had been closed to flooding in June. The road runs through a swamp and it is still very, very wet. We also passed Johnson Creek where there is a large outlet mall: Gap, Old Navy, Land's End, Eddy Bowers, Calvin Cline and Ann Taylor. The bus from Madison to Milwaukee stops here. I also learned these outlets malls are owned by companies which manage them all over the country.</p>
<p>It is fairly simple to get to my apartment from the Belt Line, a major roadway that goes around Madison.</p>
<p>Signing the lease took a long time. In part, the owner/manager was thorough. In part, I had to sign a sublet and a year's lease. In part, Madison has a lot of special ordinances because of the number of student renters. For example, state law requires twelve-hour notice for the landlord to enter; Madison requires 24-hour notice. There are lots of regulations about who can occupy the premises and for how long. Obvious again when you think about students--and immigrants, too, for that matter. I became aware of the latter when I lived in Cilacon Valley in its hayday.</p>
<p>Then we got the tour. We were rushed because it took us longer to get to Madison than we expected and because Melanie had a church meeting to get back to. The owner wanted to "sell" the apartment, this after I had written checks. I gather pride is a factor here.</p>
<p>Some surprises for me: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I hadn't realized the apartment did not have a private entrance. No matter. The last apartment didn't have one either.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The area is quite open and there are lots of trees. It feels like being in a residential area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The apartment is big.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Melanie kept saying you walk in a circle and I couldn't get it. The truth is you walk in off the hallway into a hallway. The bathroom which is small is on the left. It does have a linen closet--hurray! The kitchen is on the right. It's galley style and leads into the dining room. </p>
<p>In the hall is a large coat closet and the bedroom is off this hallway. It's huge with a large walk-in closet. After having virtually no closets in Jamestown, it's close to heaven. </p>
<p>There are windows in both the bedroom and the living room. The hall ends up in the living room. There are a set of narrow bookshelves here. The phone and cable jacks are on that wall, too, so it's a no brainer that cds, dvds, etc. will go into this bookcase. </p>
<p>Here's the very cool thing. The extra window because the unit is on the end, is in the dining room. It makes the apartment very bright and feels very much like my condo in Twin Rivers. I wouldn't be surprised if the square footage was about the same. .</p>
<p>The wood in the kitchen cabinets will go well with the wood in the new table. Patience called that right.</p>
<p>The black chairs will show Elwood's fur, but that is how it goes. Cheers for lint rollers.</p>
<p>Elwood stuck his nose into everything he could.</p>
<p>We ditched the owner and skipped the tour of the dumpsters, basement storage and laundry. Time enough for that.</p>
<p>I also met the fulltime maintenance person. We'll get to know one another well since I am a pill about things and this seems okay. </p>
<p>I checked the wireless availability from the kitchen. I'll need to subscribe to something. It looks like cable, at least for now, since dsl looks expensive and I don't need a phone. </p>
<p>Having said that, Verizon reception in the kitchen and living room is poor but not bad in the bedroom. Not 100%. It's about 65% but I think that will do as it's working at that level here at J.'s. </p>
<p>I'm feeling quite tired today. It's chilly. Elwood thought it was cold enough to move onto my bed. Not a plan. I showed him his mat, closed the window a good deal and found him laying against the quilt, but on the floor, subsequently. He may be a candidate for a dog bed. I'll have to look into this.</p>
<p>Still waiting on the movers. </p>
<p>I'm excited about how great the apartment looks. I hope I continue the bright an airy feel of it. </p>

<p>I'm excited about how great the apartment looks. I hope I continue the bright an airy feel of it. </p>

<p>I shot off an email to the moving company yesterday and within 15 minutes I got acall. Unfortunately, the cell phone wasn't nearby so it became a voice mail. They don't have a weight ticket yet; the truck was at a loading stop; they will deliver by 7/11. I can't ask for better resonse than this. The impression that things are messier than they really are is because I'm so unfamiliar with this process. I am sharing the truck with others. I will receive a call 24 hours before delivery. Melanie has advised her office. It's like waiting for a baby. This afternoon I will see the apartment. I hope to have pictures.</p>

<p>Thanks for all the comments and news. </p>
<p>Sandra, a busy day after Grace isn't a bad thing. You'll hit your stride soon. I'm looking forward to your journal resuming publication.</p>
<p>Yesterday I sat down to the computer to do some work. I ended up dealing with upgrades and system issues. It took me most of the day.</p>
<p>Last night we walked to the local Outpost Coop to buy a few things. Kiwi for breakfast is very good. </p>
<p>Melanie keeps saying it's about a mile away. Generally, it's one and a half to two miles away to these locations so we all get a good walk in.</p>
<p>Elwood is doing very well and identified the driveway on the way home. This is encouraging. He is very quiet during the day. He likes laying on the bedroom rug in the sun and watching me from the doorway while I work at the dining room table. I also suspect he is doing some sort of grieving for friends and places. Dogs do this in their own way.</p>
<p>It is set up for me to visit the apartment and do the paperwork tomorrow so I will have news. Jay still needs some content for the radio show so that is my task to accomplish this week. </p>
