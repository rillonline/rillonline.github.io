The weather here has been hotter and cooler, humid and not. Overnight temps are going down. 

Elwood and I took a walk Friday, around 3. Elwood grumbled in a dog way when I turned around at South Park, but we walked to South and Fish Hatchery, down and back on Midland and then came down Appleton. I expected to cross there--it Ts into South. To get a crosswalk, we need to walk down to West Wingra and then walk back almost to Appleton. Well, Elwood has figured out where he is. So he J walked across South. I knew because now South was on my right and not on my left. He marched down the sidewalk and turned into our driveway and up to the door. It was dinner time and Elwood does not like his dinner to be late. He is a lot like Nero Wolf in this way.

I ended up without a bulletin Sunday, but I knew most of the hymns more or less. I never know all the words. There were favorites among the familiar ones.

The sermons still don't reach me, but the worship does. My driver has lots of responsibilities so we were almost the last to leave. it's not a bad way to spend a Sunday morning though I miss Saturday night intimacy and Al's harmonica. 

I'll post the article in the church newsletter about&nbsp; Elwood and how not to interfere. First Sunday out it worked well.

Still getting life reordered for the good of the house.
