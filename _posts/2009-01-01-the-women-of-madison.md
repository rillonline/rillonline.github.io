Happy New Year to everyone!

I haven't posted for a while. Life is like that.

The kids were here Christmas Eve. We went to church together. Brian thought there was a lot of singing. If you wanted a service with lots of singing, this was it. A very good service for people who are not necessarily "into" church or who may think differently than you about church. It had singing, candle lighting, kids and the Christmas story as well as a play about how the Christmas story characters were just ordinary people like us.

The soup was a great success with people taking leftovers home. I decided's ed I need to work a little more on the soup choices. i picked 3 heavy soups and that was way too much in the stomach so a lighter soup choice needs to be found.

It's been very cold here and we've had over 38 inches of snow already. The Sunday before Christmas the wind chill was -35.

With the snow blocking routes and Elwood's creativity, I have found myself in need of help. The women of Madison have come through for me. One woman drove me to the library because the path I was on was snow-blocked. Another woman stopped her car to re-direct us as we were in no man's land along the side of a major road. She made sure we knew where we were before returning to her car.

It is very cold today but lots of people were out, especially on the bike path. I heard someone say,"We have 5 miles to go." I don't know if there was a New Year's walk in progress.

I now have GPS. Sited people can have GPS for under $100. I got GPS for under $1000. It is a dedicated unit and very simple which is what I wanted. There are cheaper solutions on cell phones, but I (a) bounced someone out of his application by fiddling with his phone and (b) I couldn't imagine myself messing around with commands on a phone at a corner in 4 degree weather like there was outside today. I can find out where I am by pushing one button with my gloves on if necessary.

I recorded our route today and learned I had walked over 2.25 miles. I need to walk more, for Elwood's sake as well as to deal with the weight which is creeping up due to inaction.

Bear in mind, the average snowfall in Madison has been 51 inches though last year they had 100. The head of the meteorology department at UW Madison does not think it will be 100 this year, but with 40 inches or so on the ground already who knows.
