We certainly are enjoying the warmer weather and dry sidewalks here in jamestown. Elwood and I have done our River Walk route and are starting to walk down 3rd Street for exercise. We found that the crossing at Washington is clear.

We went down that way when the circus was in town. Elwood was acting very strange, not focused on what I wanted him to do but investigating other people and looking around. It seems he was smelling elephants.
