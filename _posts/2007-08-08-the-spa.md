Today Elwood went to the spa. Elwood doesnot like the spa. The groomers touch his feet. They get him wet. They look into his ears. They use a blow dryer on him. But he is clean, nice smelling and they even gave him a potty break. It was hot in Lakewood my skin was burning in the sun around my collar bone.

Elwood cried when he heard my voice at the desk. I guess he thought he had been abandoned. He was excited to get his harness on and get out of there. He'll be back in two months. You have to schedule the next appointment when you are there because they are filling up quickly.

The new facility is quite large. I hope they get help.
