We went to the river walk this afternoon. I prepared for not having the picnic table. This was also our exercise today as it is again very humid.  I found a tree and tied Elwood to it. I laid a towel on the grass. Elwood raced to claim it.

I should mention that Elwood likes to sleep on towels and laundry in the other room. I call it Elwood has his own bedroom. 

I tried to get everything in order. Elwood wrapped himself in the wires of my ear buds. He rolled. He licked. He wriggled. He managed to unhook the ear buds from the iPod and lay so completely on everything I had difficulty getting reconnecting. I laid on my back. Elwood curled up with his head on my arm and was quite content.

We went through the whole thing when I went to pack up about an hour later. Something was biting my ankle and I couldn't write.

We started down the path, but Elwood vered off to the grass and when I was losing patience with his vering, he stopped in front of the picnic table bench. We stayed for anoher hour and a half. I finally put the towel downk kept one foot on it so it wouldn't blow away and Elwood settled down though he was still tied to the bench as he had been tied to the tree. 

I want to be sure I knew where he was and what he was getting into.

It continues to amaze  me how much cooler the river walk is than the street
