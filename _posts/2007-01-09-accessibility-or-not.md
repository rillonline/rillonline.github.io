<p>What caused me to sign out of Skype is not important, just start here with me on this one. I try to log back in. I discover I'm using Skype 3.0. This is unaccessible so I reinstall the program and reinstall 2.5. I click on a yes box and discover I have reinstalled 3.0. Uninstall. I install 2.5 again and say no, I do not want to upgrade. In all cases, I come to a sign in screen which is unaccessible. I can't find a password box. I cannot tab through the options. I cannot click on the sign in button, hoping my password is stored somewhere in some unknown folder and file in 100gb of laptop. So,until a sighted person comes along who may be able to unscramble this, Skype is inoperable on this computer. Sigh.
