Elwood and I have been learning a route which I'm calling our 5k walk. I don't know if it is actually 5k, but it's close enough I suspect. Today we did the part that goes over the 6th Street Bridge. 

Now the thing about Jamestown is that one street becomes another. We are walking on 5th and then we're walking on 6th and then we're walking on Fairmount and basically, we're walking along the same street.

We walked down to Hallak and then came back a ways on harding. I learned two things:

1. The driveway I thought Elwood had turn down on a previous walk ... It was Cook Avenue. For whatever reason, he didn't conect with the curb on the other side. Now I know it is a short block and there is no big shot driveway. It's the street and he needs to find the upramp on the other side.

2. Elwood has been lying about sidewalks. He claimed there weren't sidewalks led down the side streets from Harding to Fairmount. Now I know better. Don't lie to your mistress. She will find out eventually.

We also learned how to cross Fairview at Harding so we can avoid the messy intersection at Fairmount. We also learned what makes Steel Street so difficult. There's a hill and the cars have to get high enough to see the intersection which usually means pulling across the crosswalk.

On the trip, we got tangled up at the drive through. By this point, we were on our own. We had stopped in at the Blind Association and the library.
