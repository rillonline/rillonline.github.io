<p>I have never been a morning person. I can get up. I can do what is necessary, however, I am not a morning person.
<p>Today I was awakened at 5:30 a.m. with Frank Sanatra singing about coffee in Brazil. A bit jarring. Big band orchestration but not a young Sanatra singing. I stagger out of bed and start looking for clothes. The instructor arrives with food and with instructions. 
<p>"What?"
<p>"Here's a heart guard pill. Take it from your shoulder down to your dog and tell him 'Take it.'"
<p>Something new at 5:30 am?
<p>My responses must have been genetic. II sounded just like my mother in the morning. I usually don't sound like her, but in the morning ...
<p>Well, she'll have to come and search the floor. I dropped the pill while trying to give it to a very excited dog. 
<p>Note to self: Be more firm with Elwood. He can obey even before breakfast. We have different mothers.
