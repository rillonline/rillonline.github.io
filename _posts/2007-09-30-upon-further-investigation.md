We took another walk today. It was warmer. We walked along the river side of the plaza and found the street that runs along behind it. I had been right. There was just a driveway part way up the hill and when we crossed it, the sidewalk continued to the next street. We walked the two long blocks down to Lakin. It was very quiet which was very pleasant. WE turned right, crossed the little brick street and found another sidewalk which led us back to 3rd Street. Elwood was quite grumpy. I turned to walk back toward the bridge. He didn't want to do that. We had already been walking for over a half an hour. When we got to Hall, he turned. No, we're going across. He thought about not going across but I prevailed. Then I turned him back up the hill and we walked around the plaza, only crossing one superfluous street on our way around. I think we can walk down on the other side of the street, but there was the sound of construction so I forebore until a more opportune time. Elwood was still hurrumphing. He wanted to turn and walk west along 3rd Street instead of turning for home. We were out more than an hour. I'm feeling it and fell asleep in my chair this afternoon reading I Robot which I think I may have read before but there are only whispers of what I had read before. I also got the adult forum for today posted at http://thewingedox.blogspot.com/
