Today Elwood and I went to our local library. On Sunday J. and Melanie scoped it out. On the way, we said "Hi," to the farmer's market folks. If I had wanted something, I should have gotten it then because on our way back it was crowded. We had a misadventure, mistaking a driveway as a street and ending up amid housing and such. Elwood does not like retracing his steps so backtracking is difficult, but South park is a busy street so I can hear our general direction. We found our way to Villager Mall where the library is. We did pass the library and when we entered a clothing store, they urriedly told us we weren't in the right place. "The library is next door," they said. I had a helpful librarian. I am registered not only for the library but to vote and I brought home two CD books. In looking at the library site, I discovered I am reading a previous book from the library's book discussion group. The month's book is about September 11 and I don't think I want to read that so I'll wait for next month. It is disappointing. I also discovered the library has an RSS feed of its events. Right now they are starting a workshop on writing down your memories. They have story time, a knitting group and classes and help with writing--resumes, job applications, etc. 
My beach crocs arrived today. Boy were my old ones worn!
