<p>Yesterday: a second go-round of the Elm Street route. There's a ditty for the street names. I'll capitalize the street names:
<blockquote>
The King of Pine Wil not [Mont] Spring over Dumont to South.
</blockquote>
<p>Pine--we cross it twice, has a light and so does Spring. It'sw 1.5 miles long so we walked 3 miles yesterday.
<p>When we got back, my neighbor stopped by. We are still tied to our dogs. Her dog proceeded to urinate on the floor, soaking my bedspread and coat. Housekeeping was alerted about the spread. I went off to the laundry room.
I fell asleep so didn't get the coat dried before afternoon park. I used my polartek vest which was enough. On my way to the laundry downstairs, I ran into (literally) the Seeing Eye president and his dog. He apologized for interfering with my exit to park. <q>We're on our way back,</q> I told him. <q>Our shoes are safe.</q> For evening park, I couldn't locate my gloves. I have since found them.
<p>Elwood is a trial at park. I wash my shoes regularly. The instructors are starting to laugh at me. I'm always jumping back from him while I'm trying to unharness him. He also walks when he poops. I am usually standing in the middle of a circle by the time he's done. The trick will be to stop him from walking while not stopping him from pooping.
<p>We're off for another turn around the block, so to speak.
