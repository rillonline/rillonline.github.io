I got so far and then I was directed from my phone to my MacBook where I had the wrong Apple id. I fixed that and then started bouncing back and forth between the phone and the laptop. Text messages with codes kept arriving and by the time I figured out the code, the session had timed out. 
 
Start over. Click. Type. Change screen. Change machines. Time out or get locked out or just get in a loop. 
 
Half an hour later, everything has the right Apple id and password--I think.#
