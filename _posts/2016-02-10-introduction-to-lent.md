Introduction to Lent
Lent (Anglo-Saxon :spring) is the time when we prepare to celebrate the great festival of Easter. At first, the custom of fasting prior to Easter, taken from the Passover observance, lasted only for a day or two. Over centuries, fasting, penance, acts of charity, works of love and prayer were extended to the forty days before Easter excluding Sundays. Lent reminds us of the three great 40-day fasts recorded in the Bible: Moses on Mount Sinai (Exodus 34:28), Elijah’s journey to Mount Horeb (1 Kings 19:1-9) and Jesus’ temptation in the wilderness (Mark 1:13 and parallels).
