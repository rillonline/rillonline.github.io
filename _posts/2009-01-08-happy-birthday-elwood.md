Today is Elwood's 4th birthday. He was sung to last night at church and greeted this morning from St. Luke's Bible study. His birthday gift was unintentional. I changed clothes quickly last night before church and dropped them on the floor. Elwood found jeans and a sweatshirt when he came home and curled himself up on them. He was still there this morning. Such love. This was not his style when I first met him.
