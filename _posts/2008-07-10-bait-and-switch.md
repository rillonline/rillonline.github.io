Something is fishy in the charges for my move. According to the moving service, I moved 5,800 pounds. Not a chance. The money owed may or may not be correct, but certainly relates not at all to the poundage reported. The solution is to pay and go with the truck to a weigh station. Much inconvenience and irritation. Waste of time and gas, but necessary, I think, to avoid being scammed. According to the office, they loaded the truck 7/09. Try 06/28. Melanie suggested they are reading the wrong ticket. I hope it is that. I asked the coordinator via email to re-confirm info. Waiting for a response. If this does not come by afternoon, I'll call. irritating enough. Time to move on as my guest status has gotten old for everyone.

Today is melanie's birthday. I'm trying to figure out how to make this nice for her. I'm really limited here.

In addition, it is the anniversary of Caitlin's death which i still take very hard. 

I have my screen reader working better. There was a problem in the code. I knew that, but proving it was difficult. We're so responsive, blah. blah. blah. Well, only on the easy problems. It's scary when the programmer googles your problem before downloading debugging software to your computer remotely. However, this is probably the way tech will be handled in the main stream from here on out. 

Elwood is missing his time outside and walking. It is getting hot today. It was cool yesterday.

The good news is, that however the details shake out, I'll be in Madison this weekend.
