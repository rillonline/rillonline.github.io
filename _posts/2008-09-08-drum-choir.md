Yesterday our special music at church was an African Drum Choir. I gathered this is a special choir at the church. It was quite wonderful, very different from a marching band. It is clear to me how drums can be said to talk. Some people really didn't like them because of the volume. I was sitting up close and it wasn't too loud. Elwood got a little nervous, but he got through it all right. We had a good sermon, too. God is not a good idea. God is alive and relational. Again, a different version of the Lord's Prayer and "sitting" Communion this time. I discovered I had to break off a piece of bread. That changes, too, from broken off for you or breaking it yourself. My guess is that people have opinions on this, too, and so some of the people are happy at any given time.

I also went to a class which is reading Elie Wiesel's Night. The conversation should be interesting. We mostly got background info, including how IBM punched cards and leased equipment kept track of everyone in Nazi camps.

They are still digging up my streets. 

We've had rain. Last week's rain was from Gustav. I don't know about today's rain. It's much colder today, too. I went down to the storage unit to fish out some long-sleeved clothing and sweaters/jackets. Some clothes looked familiar while some did not. I have no idea what fits. I'll just put them on as I go and see.

I can now download titles from Recording for the Blind. I remember when we used flexible discs on a record player. Then we moved onto reel to reel tape. The whole library is not available yet. Titles may not be available instintly but get converted and uploaded in a few days. The licensing process is awkward as I have to use Windows Media Player, but I did sync a title to my phone and listened from there. I'm trying to see if my Zen Stone will work also. 



Grocery delivery tomorrow. The fresh food changes. I'm moving onto apples from nectarines. I am also trying a northern Chinese vegetable I have never heard of before. There is always opportunity for expanding horizons. &nbsp;
