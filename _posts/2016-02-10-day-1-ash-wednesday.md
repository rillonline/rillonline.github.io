### Create in Me

#### Reading

Psalm 51

#### Create, Renew, Restore, Uphold

This is what we desire for ourselves:

* to renew our souls,
* to have God recreate our hearts so they are clean and fresh,
* to be restored to a genuine relationship with God,
* to be upheld in the joy of being present before God,
* to know deep in our hearts that God is for us and we can trust that God is for us.

This assurance comes in the midst of Ash Wednesday. In the midst of knowing all about my own weaknesses, my own faults, my own failures, my own inability to do what I think I ought to do—to do the things I want to do—too do the things I think are right and good and wholesome to do.

Ash Wednesday is a day of facing my failures, my inadequacies, my hypocrisies—everything about me which is dirty and awful and miserable—all those things I hide from the world. But God knows. God knows all these things well. Nevertheless I can go to God and say, 

&gt;Have mercy on me. Create in me a clean heart. Renew, restore, uphold. Uphold all that is good in me. Uphold all that pleases you, God. Restore me to a sense of being where I can carry out the joy of doing your will. Create in me a clean heart.

This is our private prayer for Ash Wednesday.

#### Let us pray…

Holy God. Holy, mighty and immortal God: May I keep a Holy Lent this year. May I let you work in me to create, renew, restore and uphold me so that the fruits of your Spirit may blossom and grow in my life. Amen.
