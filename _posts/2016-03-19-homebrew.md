Today I finally understood enough to "get" that homebrew is a package installer. I installe it! I even was able to search for a program and install it: frotz.

Although I copied the installation line from the homebrew web page, I couldn't get it to work so I wrote a little bash script to do it, put it in "/usr/local/bin", used "chmod 755" to make it executable and ran it.

Apparently, "/usr/local/bin" is not in my path, but I could write out the whole path and it worked.

Now I may be able to install Nicola and use it on my pi. Hooray!
