The earlier forecast I heard indicated it would be snowing this morning but it wasn't when we went out. According to the weather report, it is snowing lightly now and the accumulation will be south of madison. We'll see.

In looking thru the forecast, it said it would be warmer Sunday--only a low overnight of 14. Tonight it could get down to 2. I ne

 have never thought of 14 as being especially warm.
