We've just come back from the groomer's. Pet Smart has a salon. It took longer than we're used to, over three hours and Elwood got the upgraded package, "Top Dog", treatment. He got an oatmeal bath, extra, moisturizers, good for dry skin and his teeth brushed which he apparently liked and tried eating the toothbrush. I was able to get him out of hock for $45. This is more than twice as much as I paid in Lakewood. He looks great. My friend picked me up; I bought coffee and at the caf&#xE9; but was treated to soup and sandwich dinner at their house. C makes bread in a bread machine so L took my bread machine back with him after droping me off so that C could check it out. I was never successful at making bread in Jamestown. We'll see what can be done. I've been romised my bread machine back with a loaf of bread Sunday. We'll see what transpires.<br />Meanwile, it was a shirt sleeves day here. Elwood and I went to the library to return books and pick up books. The cassettes are degraded, I think, so I'm reporting as I go. Elwood went past the library driveway and brought me into a construction zone. They're doing the water lines near the library. The dump truck driver came to help. He said he had seen me around. He walked me to the library. If Elwood had done the right thing, we would havenever gotten involved in the construction. On the other hand, we wouldn't know about it and given the driver a chance to stretch his legs. Everything works out.
