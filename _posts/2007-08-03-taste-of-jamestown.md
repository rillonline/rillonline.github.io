Sandi stopped by and we went to the farmer's market. 3rd Street is blocked off for the birthday celebration for a few blocks. In addition to the birthday stuff, there is a one-block mini festival called "A Taste of Jamestown." Local vendors, caterers and restaurants, are selling food. Apparently you buy tickets and pay for the food with tickets. Some picnic tables are set up.  I didn't buy anything.

So we walked down the middle of 3rd Street. Elwood found this slightly irregular. I told him that as long as he was with Sandi, he could do this.

The Farmer's Market ... Well, let's just say this is a work in progress. Lots to sniff. I said, "Leave it," a lot and corrected. There were the oblivious people and there were the people that couldn't help themselves with a dog present. Finally, Elwood just laid down at a stand. When it's over, let me know!

We came home on the other side of the street from both the market and the Taste. I think Elwood was glad to get home. I certainly was.
