Elwood and I were invited to Easter dinner. Elwood was additionally invited to&nbsp;be loose in the house. He immediately began to rush about, upstairs and down, investigating everything. The appetizers on the coffee table created some excitement. Bouncing on and off people's laps created a stirr. The biggest excitement though was when he discovered the Easter ham on the sideboard. He was apprehended with his nose a quarter of an inch from the ham.&nbsp;

A cookbook which had caused some excitement among friends this Lent&nbsp;is entitled What Jesus Would Eat. One of the dishes for our Easter dinner came from that book: couscous and apricots. It sounded quite fancy to me, but if Elwood had gotten the ham, we would have been eating much more like Jesus: green beans and couscous.&nbsp;
