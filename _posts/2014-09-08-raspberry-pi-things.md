When I think of using the Raspberry Pi, I think of software running on a pi. What i have come to realize is that other people think of things. So when a person is talking about an Internet radio, they are talking about a pi inside a case which may have a display and such. I think of a program that plays Internet radio streams. I don't need a box beyond the pi in a case.
