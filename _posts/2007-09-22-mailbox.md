I subscribe to netflix. As a result, I often have dvds to mail back. I use the mailbox behind the post office complex on East 2nd Street. There is a miailbox closer, but I use this one because it also affords us a walk especially if we go around the post office complex. I've been teaching Elwood to find the mailboxes. Previously, I had to do this by trial and error. At first, we missed it and had to go back. Today I gave the command "mailbox" beforehand, when I thought we were nearby. Elwood went right to the bank of mailboxes and I could drop my discs in. Much praise. I think I will tell him every time we take that route whether or not we have anything to mail. He wouldn't care. I could even open and close the door as if I were mailing something to emphasize his find was worthwhile. I think Elwood is gullible enough to believe I was mailing something because the concept of mailing anything is beyond him.
