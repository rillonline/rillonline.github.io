Today I made a step forward in finding ways to protect myself. I have made a pact so that a steady parishioner at my church and I will be in text contact every Sunday morning. If I say I am coming to church but I don't show up, my contact will find steps to find me.

To facilitate my accountability I have set up a reminder to text my contact every morning concerning my plans.
