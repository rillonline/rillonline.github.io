Elwood is a very smart dog. He is excellent in crossing streets and handling traffic. He relies on crosswalks. He is learning how to behave in social situations. He is affectionate and reminds me of the dogs in cartoons.

However ... Elwood has no common sense.&nbsp;Yesterday he ate a dish towel. He also got sick. Dish towels are not digestable so I have been picking up clumps of tried-to-be-digested dish towel all over the house. 

Breakfast and dinner come regularly here. Why would a dog eat a dish towel?
