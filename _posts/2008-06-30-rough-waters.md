The movers finally arrive after 5 o'clock Saturday and were very&nbsp;tired. Apparently their last pickup thought they would pack everything&nbsp;and was totally unpacked. Of course, they hadn't contracted for this. I understand they moved everything out, but left a few hinges behind. Fortunately, they will be mailed. They did, however, litter which I will report.

My daughter-in-law arrived at work after vacation to discover her boss thought she would be out today and scheduled a meeting for all day tomorrow when we planned to sign the lease. I have emailed the apartment and I hope Wednesday will be okay.

Not n knowing when the stuff will arrive here in Wisconsin is frustrating and a big unsettling. Also missing my daughter-i-law's emails because I have the mesage notification turned off makes me feel a bit incompetent. I am, however, moving forward with some more moving details. All in good time. An interstate move seems very complicated this time though I've done it before. I think it is because I am not closely associated with my things. Maybe life gets more complicated.

Yesterday Melanie's family came for dinner and that was pleasant. J. and I had coffee together at a shop with outdoor tables. I'm also checking into the new desktop computer so that I can check in with Bible study from time to time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
