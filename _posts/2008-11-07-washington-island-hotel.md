There is a hotel on Washington Island, Wisconsin. You can only get onto the island by ferry. Why am I telling you thiss? Because I went with melanie and J. to the Washington Island Coffee Shop which is a few blocks from my house. I didn't know it was there until recently. The office manager clued me into this and we will be going over the route on Monday. However, today Melanie and J. came to Madison on their way to a "romantic" weekend in Dodgeville. I think this is where land's End is located. If not, the town has a similar name. The coffee shop adjoins a knitting store. The restaurant is large and airy and in good weather, you can sit outside overlooking a park. Today it was sleeting when we went there and we were all quite cold and wet. I didn't have gloves. Melanie didn't have a scarf. We had lunch--pheasant quiche, broccoli and cheese soup, an autumn salad with apples and pumpkin seeds, a pickle and such sandwich. Those were our choices along with some other things. And of course, coffee. Just wonderful and delicious and a great beginning to a get-away weekend. The food is from the Washington island Hotel and Culinary School--fresh baked bread and locally grown produce where available and Fair Trade coffee. Pricey, too, but well worth it.

On Wednesday morning Elwood and I and our teacher walked to lake Wingra.

In all these adventures, Elwood does not like journeys that require retracing his steps. At the Seeing eye, all routes do not require backtracking. Not practical from everyday life, but practical for the trainers.

I am trying the bread maker for the second time. It turns out I had set the bread machine up incorrectly. The office manager stopped by to read the display and straighten things out.
