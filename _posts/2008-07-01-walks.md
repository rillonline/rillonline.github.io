Thanks for all the comments and news.&nbsp;

Sandra, a&nbsp;busy day after Grace isn't a bad thing. You'll hit your stride soon. I'm looking forward to your journal resuming publication.

Yesterday I sat down to the computer to do some work. I ended up dealing with upgrades and system issues. It took me most of the day.

Last night we walked to the local Outpost Coop to buy a few things. Kiwi for breakfast is very good.&nbsp;

Melanie keeps saying it's about a mile away. Generally, it's one and a half to two miles away to these locations so we all get a good walk in.

Elwood is doing very well and identified the driveway on the way home. This is encouraging. He is&nbsp;very quiet during the day. He likes laying on the bedroom rug in the sun and watching me from the doorway while I work at the dining room table. I also&nbsp;suspect&nbsp;he is doing some sort of grieving for friends and places. Dogs do this in their own way.

It is set up for me to visit the apartment and do the paperwork tomorrow so I will have news. Jay still needs some&nbsp;content for the radio show&nbsp;so that is my task to accomplish this week.&nbsp;
