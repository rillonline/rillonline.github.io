Elwoodhas been suffering from cabin fever. First, it was snowing all the time and&nbsp;I was uncertain &nbsp;&nbsp; even where the sidewalk was. Second, it got very, very cold and windy and I thought it was too cold to be out for long. Elwood doesn't like the cold. It is like being with a little kid. "I want to go out! I want to go out!" So you bundle them all up. It takes forever. Five minutes later they're back in the house. "I'm cold." And then it takes forever to get them out of everything. That is how Elwood is. He feels the cold.

Then, I started fighting off whatever is going 'round and I've felt very, very tired. And of course, guilty, that Elwood isn't getting exercise. niether am I for that matter.&nbsp;

We were at church, at the healing service. Elwood pushed in front of me at the rail. I said, "Elwood has a prayer request. He wants to go for a walk." Someone further down the line said, "I'm running errands at lunchtime. I'll be by for him. Ask and ye shall receive."

So Elwood went out--sniffing all the way. He visited at the thrift shop. He went to his friend's house. He visited the park. I've never been to some of these places.

Today it was bright and sunny. Although it hasn't been especially warm, the solar gain has been such that a lot of snow has melted. We went for our walk. The only tricky part was the viaduct. There are still some very icy&nbsp;patches and I hit one. The river walk is almost clear except for the shadiest section. The river is quite noisy so the water level must be high or there&nbsp;are lots of objects in the river for the water to spill over and around. Elwood was pleased with our outing.&nbsp;&nbsp;
