For fun, I am writing a “kramdown” post to see how it comes out.

It’s Name —-

“Kramdown” is “markdown” spelled backwards—at least “mark” is spelled backwards.

## It’s Advantage

Kramdown can do tables and definition lists. These can come in handy sometimes. Oh, yes, and it can do footnotes, too.

## Some Questions

* Does Drupal support kramdown?
* Is there a kramdown mode for emacs?
