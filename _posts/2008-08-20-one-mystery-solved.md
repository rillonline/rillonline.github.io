I've had a lot of pain in my left shoulder. It has made doing a lot of tasks painful including working with Elwood since I hold the harness in my left hand. I thought it was a lot of things, some quirky and some dire, but I think I've solved the mystery. Because we cannot get the router working, I've been sitting at the computer desk and the keyboard of the laptop is at the wrong height. My shoulder doesn't get better because I use the keyboard every day. Having discovered this, I'm trying a work around: I plugged the keyboard from the desktop into the laptop and I'm&nbsp;sitting on a chair nearby with the keyboard in my lap. It's a little large for this purpose, but it's lighter than the whole laptop and I can deal with the USB cable. i was pleased that the laptop recognized the keyboard and transferred control to it. When I'm not using the keyboard I can set it on the keyboard shelf I bought for the desk and get it out when I need it. I also grabbed one of the dining room chairs to sit on which are comfortable. The only inconvenience so far is that I haven't bothered to plug in external speakers and so I'm using the laptop speakers. When a truck goes by I can't hear what the computer is saying, but then I could be sitting in front of it and have the same problem.
