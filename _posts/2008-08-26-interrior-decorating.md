When I signed the lease, there was much emphasis on proper care of walls--no nails or tape. Picture hanging was offered. I decided, with the kids' help, that the large pictures should hang in the dining room. I figured the clocks could hang theere, too, out of the way but available to be wound. Unfortunately, many suitable walls have circuit breakers, thermostats, door phone, light switches, phone jacks and the like where something could be hung. The builders had first dibs. The maintenance man and a different helper arrived today, measured, had opinions and got the job done. The maintenance man has made three grandfather clocks. We talked about the Amana Colony and their clocks and furniture-making. One of the chains had jumped off its gear and he fiddled for some time to get it back on. Now everything is ticking along well. He even tightened the hands on the chiming clock, though he'll have to come back to adjust the hour hand. The clock is sounding one hour and reading another. Now I feel I am not living in a sterile environment.
