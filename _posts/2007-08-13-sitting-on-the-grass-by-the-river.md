I thought we would spend some time on the River Walk.Unfortunately, other people were at the picnic bench, a 3-generational family. Elwood thought we should join them.  They did not invite us so I found this tree. Elwood is doing what dogs do with trees--get tangled around them. Nest time, I will bring a towel. My windbreaker is a little small to sit upon.

Earlier we did our 5k. We got lost. We ended up several blocks away from our target but people are helpful and we got ourselves reoriented. Fairmount residential and 3rd? We wanted 5th. Go this way. I hope Elwood appreciates the walk and that we need to be a little more attentive to our route rather than exploring the neighborhood.

I had wanted to sit by the babbling part of the river. Instead I have air conditioners but it's the principle of the thing. We have a breeze and temperatures in the 70s which is far preferable to me. I still had to strip after our big walk.
