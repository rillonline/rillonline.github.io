I wanted to use the SA Mobile Network connection to ACB Radio and ABC TV. It started out badly with someone rambling so I switched to Democracy Now. Alice Walker is cohosting with Amy. I think the last and first Inauguration I paid so much attention to was JFK's. We had the day off from school because of the snow.
