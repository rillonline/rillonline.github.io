I'm proud to be Celtic today, but then I'm proud to be Celtic every day.

It was incredibly warm today. I wore a sweatshirt outside and was too hot.

We took a very long walk with panting and everything. We went to Regent Street via the Arbor item. Dogs and their people were everywhere and all the dogs misbehaved. I guess they are thinking it has been a long winter, too. 

I thought I would see if I could find the dock, but I didn't and went on to Regent Street to see how the walk down South Randall turned out. L had driven it and said there was sidewalk all the way and there is. Along Vilas--I don't know exactly how I ended up on Vilas--there is a very steep hill so not a plan for winter months to walk there. 

I went into this cafe where I had been previously. We ended up at the kitchen and the guys there acted very weird. I decided they lacked social skills. perhaps they were closed, but there door was open. They gave me a bottle of soda on the house and I thought I'd sit, drink the diet Coke and listen to my iPod. Well, being in an empty cafe is a really weird experience and I had the iPod upside down in the arm strap. By the time I took off my sweatshirt, fixed the iPod and drank a little soda, it was too weird to stay so we left. I almost thought I was locked in the place. The doors wouldn't push open. Eventually,, I found a release very low on the door and we left. It was beginning to feel very much like a horror movie.

Of course I had to walk around&nbsp;with a full poop bag in my pocket. I wonder if the guys at the restaurant could smell it and wondered&nbsp;what might be wrong with me. Unfortunately, I can't find garbage cans. On one&nbsp;corner I found some bins but decided they could easily be mailboxes and I didn't want to mail the stuff.

People were everywhere. Traffic rolls pretty slowly around town except for the major thoroughfares. We were out for about 2 hours, walking most of the time. Elwood actually thought he'd like to get home, get a drink and get some dinner.

It's supposed to cool down tomorrow and maybe rain or snow or something.

It was windy today, too. It would have been March nasty if it was colder.&nbsp;
