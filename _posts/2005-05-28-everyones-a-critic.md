You might think that, being blind, I have no interest in paintings or other forms of visual art. You would be wrong about that. I'm fascinated by art and what other people bring to the pictures.

Last year people at the "Stations of the Windows" Friday Lenten worship services at ST. Luke's http://www.wingedox.com/ described the stained glass windows. They were so enthusiastic it grew dark before we could finish the window descriptions and the service.

Today's New York Times http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/28/arts/design/28podc.html?ex=1274932800&amp;en=db1c6d7073dcc036&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss has an article about unofficial museum guides. It's a college art project at Marymount Manhattan College. http://mod.blogs.com/art_mobs/ Even if you're not at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, you can download the podcasts and look at the paintings online.

I downloaded the podcast on Pablo Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, a Discussion by Cheryl Stoever &amp; Professor Jason Rosenfeld. http://homepage.mac.com/dave7/ArtMobs/FileSharing52.html It's rough. It's raw. It's fascinating. It's listening in on a college professor going one on one with his student, asking her questions, giving additional information about the painting, giving a perspective on what the picture is about. It's just the sort of thing I want people to tell me about art.
