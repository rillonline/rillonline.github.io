<p>Seeing Eye Dog</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We are delighted to have Rev. Merrill Woolnough, who recently moved to Madison from Jamestown New York, worshiping with us.&nbsp; Her Seeing Eye Dog named Elwood accompanies her.&nbsp; Parents and others have asked about how they should relate to the dog. Merrill has asked us to share the following in answer to this question:</p><p>
Elwood is a yellow Labrador Retriever.&nbsp; He is three years old. We met at the Seeing Eye in Morristown, NJ in December, 2006 where we trained together for almost 3 weeks.</p><p>Seeing Eye dogs are chosen for their intelligence and ability to guide a blind person safely. They are not guard dogs. Protectiveness is not a desired trait because it would limit the blind person's ability to interact socially and professionally. As a result, Elwood is always glad to see people. However, interacting with him is dangerous, not for you, but for me. If he is distracted by a new friend, he may 
not be focused on his job, letting me know about obstacles such as&nbsp; stairs and walls. This is particularly important in an unfamiliar environment like the church building.</p><p>Please do not touch Elwood or speak to him, especially by name. Using his name is how I get his attention to follow a command.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
