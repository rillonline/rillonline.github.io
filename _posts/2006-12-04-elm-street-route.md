<p>We started to learn the Elm Street route. It is basically pie-shaped with the north side of South Street forming the crust of the pie. Elm Street forms one side of the slice and five streets:
<ol>
<li>King</li>
<li>Pine</li>
<li>Wilmont</li>
<li>Spring</li>
<li>Dumont</li>
</ol>
are on the other side.
<p>It's cold and windy today. We passed day laborers looking for work. They must be very cold as their streets were shady and the wind was blowing. I was there about 8:30 a.m. Have they been standing around since 3 or 4 a.m.?
<p>Elwood has some do-overs--a dog distraction and a barrier of the construction tape across the sidewalk variety. We are learning how to work together. Elwood is sensitive and needs support to assertively push me if he needs to go around an obstacle. I need to help him to gain confidence to do this. 
<p>We also had a traffic check--the class supervisor drove a van toward us, causing Elwood to back up. I need to learn how to back up with him. These are staged and I know they are coming.  they are carried out on the streets and in driveways.
<p>The cars and vans the staff drive have the Seeing Eye logo on them. Sometimes they get stopped by the public, wondering why they are trying to run over the people with dogs. They have to explain what they are doing. Once when an instructor was working with someone without a dog but with the harness, someone came up to the instructor and said, k, <q>Didn't they used to have dogs doing this? Have you replaced them with human beings?</q>
