Today I went shopping with 2 new friends from church. We hit Good Will first. I found jeans, shirts of various kinds, tan pants, a wool pair of pants, a merino sweater to match and a comfy red valore shirt. My discount card from Good Will is not valid in Madison. Elwood hung out with our driver. Elwood does not like hanging out but he doesn't like changing rooms either. Then we went to lunch--an Albanian owned diner with American style food--very pleasant. Elwood was very good as he and I were reunited and basking in that was enough for him. We did Walmart afterward to find a few things unavailable at Good Will. A good time was had by all and will be repeated when they return from Upper Michigan peninsula. &nbsp;
