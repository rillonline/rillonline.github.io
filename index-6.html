<p>We went to mail letters. I have to locate the box along the street without any clear landmark. Elwood is getting the idea so we found it easily today. We could not retrace our steps. Elwood insisted we take the long way home.</p>

<p>Elwood and I have been learning a route which I'm calling our 5k walk. I don't know if it is actually 5k, but it's close enough I suspect. Today we did the part that goes over the 6th Street Bridge. </p>
<p>Now the thing about Jamestown is that one street becomes another. We are walking on 5th and then we're walking on 6th and then we're walking on Fairmount and basically, we're walking along the same street.</p>
<p>We walked down to Hallak and then came back a ways on harding. I learned two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The driveway I thought Elwood had turn down on a previous walk ... It was Cook Avenue. For whatever reason, he didn't conect with the curb on the other side. Now I know it is a short block and there is no big shot driveway. It's the street and he needs to find the upramp on the other side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elwood has been lying about sidewalks. He claimed there weren't sidewalks led down the side streets from Harding to Fairmount. Now I know better. Don't lie to your mistress. She will find out eventually.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We also learned how to cross Fairview at Harding so we can avoid the messy intersection at Fairmount. We also learned what makes Steel Street so difficult. There's a hill and the cars have to get high enough to see the intersection which usually means pulling across the crosswalk.</p>
<p>On the trip, we got tangled up at the drive through. By this point, we were on our own. We had stopped in at the Blind Association and the library.</p>

<p>My sister had a Pebbles doll after the Flintstone baby in the 1960s. She had a bone in her hair. You could always tell a Pebbles doll.</p>
<p>Elwood is like this. He seems to always have a bone in his mouth. I'm sure it would be one of the characteristics of an Elwood cartoon and he is very definitely a cartoon dog. The original cartoonist had a dog like Elwood I am sure.</p>

<p>Today Brian and I went to explore the river walk that runs between South Main and Harrison along the Chattaquine. That's probably not how it is spelled but it is how it is pronounced.) It's just a black-topped path along the riverside, a grassy bank separating it from the water. There are trees and ducks. The water flows over some debris creating tiny rapids and babbly. The path runs behind the CVS and the JAMA building. There's a picnic table, too. I have plans for it. I hope Elwood and I can make good use of this area since we have no outdoor area near our apartment and this isn't too far.</p>

<p>Sandi stopped by and we went to the farmer's market. 3rd Street is blocked off for the birthday celebration for a few blocks. In addition to the birthday stuff, there is a one-block mini festival called "A Taste of Jamestown." Local vendors, caterers and restaurants, are selling food. Apparently you buy tickets and pay for the food with tickets. Some picnic tables are set up.  I didn't buy anything.</p>
<p>So we walked down the middle of 3rd Street. Elwood found this slightly irregular. I told him that as long as he was with Sandi, he could do this.</p>
<p>The Farmer's Market ... Well, let's just say this is a work in progress. Lots to sniff. I said, "Leave it," a lot and corrected. There were the oblivious people and there were the people that couldn't help themselves with a dog present. Finally, Elwood just laid down at a stand. When it's over, let me know!</p>
<p>We came home on the other side of the street from both the market and the Taste. I think Elwood was glad to get home. I certainly was.</p>

<p>I'm posting this from my PDA. Hopefully this means I will be get back into posting on this blog more frequently.</p>
<p>A week or so ago Elwood and I walked down East 2nd Street to Washington Street. We were avoiding 3rd Street which has a lot of people-centered obstacles on it. Elwood stoped. He was having trouble, I thought, with a pole. Yes,there was a pole. It also turned out there was a hole.My right foot went in. Fortunately, the hole had a bottom and didn't go to China before coming to the end. I scraped my shin on the concrete and made Elwood take note of the hole. Then we went to the corner. Elwood was quite anxious. The day before he had rammed me into the planter there. The sidewalk is narrow so navigation is treacherous.</p>
<p>I checked the hole out with Sally. It had been filled in, not concreted over, just filled with dirt.</p>
<p>Today Sally called. She had first read in the newspaper and then checked it out in person ... The building with the planter, it's been torn down and will become a parking lot. The sidewalk is blocked off. </p>
<p>"I'll tell Elwood he doesn't have to worry about the planter anymore," I said.</p>
<p>With the current Lucy fest underway--I think this is her birthday celebration--3rd is out and now 2nd is off limits. It looks like it's 4th St. To get to Washington if it gets cool enough to take our long walk. Hot, hazy, humid with a chance of thunderstorms for the next week.</p>

<p>Elwood and I are getting ready to go to Fredonia to worship at First Baptist and celebrate Pentecost. Elwood's preparation has been getting brushed. He went to the groomer's Wednesday for a long overdue bath. (There was a 5-week wait. I didn't want him to get wet during the very cold winter months since getting completely dry before going outside is difficult.) That got a lot of his fur off, but, apparently, he is doing some serious shedding. I opted out of my black pants to go with my red shirt.</p>
<p>We've been having Lucy Days here but, at least on my street, they have not been wel-attended. Last night one of the vendors was taking down his booth. This year there were booths with awnings. I know. I almost knocked one of them down.</p>
<p>Elwood's difficulty was that he thought he knew how our sidewalk was. Then he came outside to discover it completely changed. More people. Booths with food. Generators running. He wanted to investigate. I wanted to take him out and get back inside with as little inconvenience as possible.</p>
<p>Last night we ran into a barricade. We got around it. The barricade was in our way because it had been moved to keep the street open. I was under the impression the street was open because cars kept coming down Pine Street. To avoid the barricade on the way back, we crossed in the middle of the street but it was all quiet--8 o'clock on a Saturday night during a festival and no one was around. It was overcast and chilly, getting colder all day.   </p>

<p>Today Elwood and I participated in a 5k run-walk. You can <a href="http://thewingedox.blogspot.com/2007/05/5k.html">go here</a>
to learn more.
</p>
<p>We've been doing well, going about town. Elwood likes to go places. Just walking bores him. Today was better. He went places he had never been before.
</p>
<p>One day recently we went to the Blind Association. You have to keep your history straight to do this ... Washington, lafayette, Jefferson, Clinton. I'm
sure the street is named for the governor of New York, not the president and you would then have to keep Bill's middle name and last name straight. Anyway,
we pass the library. On the way bback, Elwood decided we needed to go to the library. How do you tell the librarian you need help finding a cd-book because
your dog thought you needed to borrow one?
</p>
<p>We are also learning how to get to Tim Horton's. Elwood is on a mission (I don't think from God) to find the front door. Heaven help you if you are coming
out. We went. No problem. I had lunch. No real problem. We found the correct door out--one of my concerns. Then, somehow, we were walking through the parking
lot and not on the sidewalk.
</p>
<p>The thing here is to stay safe and let your dog work. Easier said than done. I tried to figure out where we were. Eventually, I felt we were near a building.
I assume we had worked our way to Big Lots and the dollar store. We have walked with a friend from Tim Horton's there. Then I found a vehicle and a curb,
but I couldn't get up on the curb because there were bushes and then another car. What to do?
</p>
<p>Then the person in the car behind us did something truly marvelous.
</p>
<blockquote>
Are you looking for the atm?
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, we were in the drive-through for the bank!
</p>
<blockquote>
No, I'm trying to get to the sidewalk.
</blockquote>
<p>The person then gave me clear and simple directions. Cross the driveway in front of the car, go up the grassy embankment and onto the sidewalk. When
we were there, I turned right and hoped for the best. It was quite a trek back to the corner, but we made it and home, too.
</p>
<p>We will work with our mobility instructor about getting out of Tim Horton's successfully. Obviously, Elwood was up for an adventure and not for going
home. Would Tim Bits help?</p>
