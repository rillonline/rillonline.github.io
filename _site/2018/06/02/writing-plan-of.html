    <h2 id="writing-plan-of-sorts">writing plan of sorts</h2>

<p>OK. #BlogEveryDay didn’t work for me. I thought I would try #WriteEveryDay. I wanted to start on June  1st, but obviously that did not come to pass. Nevertheless, I still want to write regularly. That doesn’t actually mean that I will post every day. The writing may not be in a form to post or it may be too private to post.</p>

<p>I am not an avid reader of memoirs or autobiographies. However, I am frequently drawn to the idea of writing a memoir–not of a particular time in my life but different sketches of things I remember. More and more I am sharing little stories with my family. I often begin talking with my grandchildren: “When I was a girl…” It sounds so old-fashioned as if I were on the prairie. (Can you tell I’ve moved to the Midwest?)</p>

<p>I have also noticed that I want to write about my experiences in my new city. I am taking buses, exploring new organizations and meeting new people. So much of my storytelling is shared with my friends. As I think this is vital, I am also aware that these stories are ephemeral. Yet I tell them over and over again with each new person.</p>

<p>Should these stories last? The right to be forgotten has raised this question. Should some things just go away? Are these stories important just for an hour, a day or a week?</p>

<p>I have discovered that my little stories are fun to look at later. In this vain, I want to start capturing them. The only way to do this is to write them down or record them. I can do both or either as I chchoose.Huzzah. Here is a page of writing for today. It may be more like The Artist’s Way daily pages, but at least it’s writing.</p>
