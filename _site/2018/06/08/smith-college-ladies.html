    <p>promo for an NPR program interviewing the president of Smith College. When I was young, my mother took us to the Smith College book sale in Princeton. We went more than a single time I am sure. The ladies–you could not call them anything else–were very proper and precise. My mother -ted later that there were the upperclass of Princeton society. What else? They graduated from Smith.  My mother must have bought books. I suspect they were novels. My encounter with the Smithies was when my mother papd. Thinking back, these women must have married well. They served their -munity by volunteering for worthy causes and raising money for their alma mater to educate more women for their new place in society. #WriteEveryDay College.When I was young, my mother took us to the Smith College book sale in Princeton.
