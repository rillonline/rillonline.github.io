  <article class="post-content e-content">
	<p>I want to write one of the books in my Magic Lands series. I’ve started the first book and I’m excited about a second book which I have started to plan.</p>

<p>This series is based on my <a href="https://nanowrimo.org">Nanowrimo</a> novel from  2013 or 2014. That’s a long time ago.</p>

<p>So I went back to the beginning and I am doing a very rough editing job on <em>Behind Enemy Lines</em> which features both Detective Ronnie Camberwell and Captain Star Runner narrating.</p>

<p>My characters are in a fairly new to them part of Space which calls itself the Primary Zone. (It’s Primary because all the people think of themselves as primary.) There is a lot of ancient history, a variety of peoples and a large canvas to create a history of how the different empires interacted.</p>

<p>And here’s the problem: One of the races is missing.  Where they go? Can they be found? Are they coming back? What was their relation to the other founding empires?</p>

<p>And, I am finding out, what part of space did they occupy?</p>

<p>The specific question I am wrestling with right now is where is Planet X? Is it in the Magic Lands or not?</p>

<p>At first, I thought it was. But that begs the question: If it is magical now, why wasn’t it magical way back when? And if it is not in the Magic Lands, which makes loads more sense, where is it? How near to the Magic Lands is it? How near to everything and everyone else?</p>

<p>I wouldn’t be concerned about all this underlying stuff except I am uncovering a rough history of the region and it matters.</p>
