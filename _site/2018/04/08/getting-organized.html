	<p>I  did not write yesterday. Even though my plan was to write every day, the only thing I wrote was a list of things to write today.</p>

<p>What I did do was purchase <a href="https://red-sweater.com">MarsEdit</a> so that I can fully access my [micro.blog(https://rill.micro.blog).  The iOS app is not fully accessible; neither is the web site. This makes editing my posts difficult if not impossible after they are posted. With <a href="https://red-sweater.com">MarsEdit</a> I can work on my Mac and fix any mistakes.</p>

<p>What I did not realize initially was that my blog posts were in plain text. My markdown was not working because I had not set up an “About” page.  I will have to make sure they are now properly formatted.</p>

<p>I am still pretty shaky with MarsEdit. I hope I can become more proficient in the future.</p>

<p>I am trying to write this post using my Braille display. It is quite hard at the moment because I am using</p>

<ul>
  <li>a new app</li>
  <li>my Mac</li>
  <li>andthe Braille display</li>
</ul>

<p>I am shaky using the Braille display connected to the Mac and I haven’t consulted the documentation. Soon I will have to look up how to control the Mac with this device.</p>

<p>Later …  Markdown is working on the site. I used different ways of indicating unordered lists and different strategies for posting  so the lists look different even in the same post:* simple lists</p>
<ul>
  <li>white bullets* and regular bullets
In any case, MarsEdit 
is working with my blog <a href="rill.micro.blog">rill.micro.blog</a>.
#BlogEveryDay</li>
