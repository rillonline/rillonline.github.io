  <article class="post-content e-content">
	<p>Today I worked with my mobility instructor to understand how to take the bus to <a href="http://vision-forward.org">Vision Forward</a>. I was relieved to learn that the bus stop near my apartment is easy to find. Both Nick and I were disappointed that I did not bring “you found the pole” treats with me. Blame the cold weather. The treats were in a lighter weight jacket.</p>

<p>As my instructor had another appointment after mine, I elected not to take the bus to the transfer point but to have him drive us there.</p>

<p>I get off the bus at the corner and then I have a choice:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I can cross a busy street to get to the next bus stop. (There is a shelter there.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can walk down a fairly long block to find another bus stop. It is right at the cornerand very easy to find.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the weather is good and there is time, walking a block sounds like a very easy solution to me. It also gives Nick a chance to relieve himself if necessary. Crossing busy streets is not always a comfortable option. It means listening very carefully to traffic changing direction when the light changes. With my moderate hearing loss in one ear (corrected by a hearing aid), I do not hear as well as I once did. Sometimes it is hard to pick up the surge of traffic and therefore have the full cycle to cross the street.</p>

<p>Afterwards, we simulated getting off the bus coming home from <a href="http://visionccforward.org">Vision Forward</a>.</p>

<p>Nick was doing well, but he wanted to check the bus shelter and was not particularly interested in finding the pole. Again, I could not bribe him with treats. I suspect he will come through on the day I actually make the trip.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to conquering this trip as I plan to be a frequent visitor to <a href="http://vision-forward.org">Vision Forward</a>. I can take Paratransit at a higher cost. This means sharing rides and possibly spending much more time onboard.</p>
