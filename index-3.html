<p>Well, not really snow. More like heavy frost, a covering, icy. Off we go. Elwood has never worked in snow and ice. Fortunately, he grew up where he has already encountered what it is. And like my other dog, snow is good. I'm wondering how he will understand that human beings do not have 4-paw drive. My shoes held up. Elwood held up. Even I held up. We made our excursion without anyone falling down. Hurray!</p>

<p>What caused me to sign out of Skype is not important, just start here with me on this one. I try to log back in. I discover I'm using Skype 3.0. This is unaccessible so I reinstall the program and reinstall 2.5. I click on a yes box and discover I have reinstalled 3.0. Uninstall. I install 2.5 again and say no, I do not want to upgrade. In all cases, I come to a sign in screen which is unaccessible. I can't find a password box. I cannot tab through the options. I cannot click on the sign in button, hoping my password is stored somewhere in some unknown folder and file in 100gb of laptop. So,until a sighted person comes along who may be able to unscramble this, Skype is inoperable on this computer. Sigh.</p>

<p>I had fun today. I wrote an email to Elwood's sister Eiffel in his name, detailing Elwood's recent activities and sending sis birthday greetings. I just received a response in Eiffel's name for Elwood. Elwood seemed uninterested while Eiffel detailed her helpful ways ... picking up paper and removing socks from laundry hooks. Good news ... Eiffel is getting on well with the previous dog guide, Valerie, a golden retriever.</p>

<p>Today is Elwood's birthday. He is two. I hope this year is filled with good things for him and me and that the terrible 2s do not apply to dogs.
</p>
<p>Elwood has made a decision: Breakfast first. Park second. I an live with this.
</p>
<p>God watch over my dog and me.l</p>

<p>Today Elwood was quite funny.
</p>
<ol>
<li>When we got into the car to go to church, Elwood tried sitting on my lap. He has done this more since he got his tail caught in the door. After I convinced him to get into the foot well, he positioned his nose under the dash and left his harness in my lap--opposite of what is usually done.</li>
<li>During the sermon, Elwood fell asleep. Good. Well, not so good. He started dreaming. His feet were going. His whole body was shaking. He began yipping. He started barking and there wasn't any correction I could give him. He was asleep. I thought about waking him up, but that really didn't seem fair. The pastor said afterward: <q>Not only do I put people to sleep. Now I put dogs to sleep, too.</q>
</li>
<li>Elwood has a rubbery toy called a cong. It's wider at the bottom than at the top with rings getting smaller and smaller. Both ends are open. Sometimes he carries it in his mouth. Tonight he began racing around, running up and down the hall. Whoever created the sounds in cartoons of animals running and then screeching to a stop knew a dog like el wood. That's exactly what it sounds like. He also began making noises through the cong. It sounded like a hooting noise. I was laughing so hard I couldn't get his harness on. I had him give me the cong, put it on the bookcase, he took it back and the running and noisemaking started all over again. He knew I would just laugh. Finally I said to him, <q>We have to get serious,</q> and we did.</li>
</ol>

<p>We've had a busy time of it. Elwood and I left at 4:30 a.m. for the airport to go to my son's wedding. The flights themselves were uneventful. The ground processing was slow and frustrating. We learned it's a half an hour walk from Terminal C to Terminal A in Detroit.
</p>
<p>Elwood was terrific at the wedding and the reception. Lots of people didn't even know a dog was present. That's an important test for me ... Does my dog know when it's important to behave?
</p>
<p>Elwood learned the hotel pretty well ... where the elevator was, how to go in and out and how to get to the restaurant. He really preferred to show me the stairs, but they were in his direct line of sight while the elevator was at an angle.
</p>
<p>Fast food restaurants continue to be problematic--too much food on the floor and too much activity. Elwood is very definitely a pack animal. If anyone around him is up, he believes he should be up.
</p>
<p>Today a friend sewed both his mats since he is thinking they might be fun to chew on. He has bones. He has other toys all of which have good chew value.
</p>
<p>Today I caught his tail in the car door. I'm not proud of this. Elwood shrieks quite effectively. afterward, he stayed in my lap. </p>
<blockquote>I'm not going back down there on that floor!</blockquote>
<p>I finally convinced him otherwise. He certainly is quite dramatic and milks his advantage for all its worth.</p>

<p>It';s absolutely dreary here. I read the weekend forecast for Milwaukee and it will be the same there. So much for concern about snow. So much for my plan about coat, etc. 
</p>
<p>We did have a touch of snow this morning. More slippery than anything else to say about it.
</p>
<p>I've been dealing with a cold or some thing so have given being sick priority to get done before Friday. It has blown a hole in what I had planned to do this week. No energy at all. I have made myself walk with Elwood some as he would be unmanageable otherwise. He has had to be patient  about park times and has done really well.
</p>
<p>At a friend's house, Elwood found another dog's play sock and had great fun with it Unfortunately, when I had difficulty getting up this morning, he used his mat as a sock and chewed a corner. I have a second one on order so this one can be sewed. 1000 teal poop bags came today. They're all contained in one box that is quite manageable as are the bags so we're set for a good while. I elected not to order rose or green ones.</p>

<p>A crazy day yesterday, Christmas Eve. Morning worship in Fredonia. Elwood was fantastic.
</p>
<p>Elwood does not care for baking. It means he has to watch from his tie down and I take forever!
</p>
<p>Then on to a festive supper with friends. They had cats--cats who wanted to play with Elwood's tail!
</p>
<p>Then the service... We went early because our ride had to be at choir practice. Elwood doesn't care for classical music in the big church. He was very antsy. Also, people kept coming over and that made him bouncy, too.
</p>
<p>Then waiting, waiting, waiting while the special music was performed before the service. I have only encountered this in Jamestown.
</p>
<p>Then onto the service itself. I read. Elwood bounced around. I kept focused on the reading.
</p>
<p>Then he laid quietly throughout the rest of the service. Curiously, no one fetched us for communion.
</p>
<p>Then more waiting around for the ride home. I would have had us walk, but we had stuff to carry.
</p>
<p>A late night park (actually, at 1 a.m., and we slept in.
</p>
<p>Now we're off to a.m. service and communion, I hope.
</p>
<p><strong>Merry Christmas!</strong></p>

<p>Elwood and I have had a busy week.
</p>
<p>Elwood, apparently, has not previously had exposure to church. Having gone Saturday night, he was able to survive the Cantata at the Methodist church. He did jump up periodically when everyone else did and when there was applause.
</p>
<p>We are learning other people's cars. I have asked my friends to remember what worked.
</p>
<p>Then there was Wednesday night and Thursday morning ... Elwood found a traditional Vespers service with chanting and candlelight more than he could take. He wriggled out of his harness and climbed on the pew and me. Holding him with one hand, I unbuckled the harness and got it back on him to settle him back down again. My pewmate said: <q>I figured out you didn't want a lighted candle to hold.</q>
</p>
<p>We had practiced resting in the pew alone every day. What I hadn't planned on Thursday morning was that everyone gets up. Elwood got up, too. I ended up with the flixileash wrapped around Elwood, the pew and myself. More practice needed.
</p>
<p>We have a new place at the table for doughnuts afterward. We have to sit far away from the person who comes with dog biscuits in his pocket and who cannot restrain himself. Children are always better. They know about rules.
</p>
<p>Bible study was also a trial. The children had been in the room with cookies the night before.
</p>
<p>Park is going better.
</p>
<p>Elwood prefers the elevator to the stairs.
</p>
<p>Today we took a walk, down 2nd Street, up Prindergast, across on 5th and back down Main. After doing all this walking, Elwood suddenly made a turn. He had found St. Luke's. He was convinced that was where we were going. It took a lot of persuading, after a lot of praise, to convince him to pass it up.
</p>
<p>We have elected to go to the late service Christmas Eve. I didn't think either of us could manage the early one with the pageant. I'm vesting and reading. Elwood's first time at the lectern. It's not hard--I hope.
</p>
<p>I may finally have gotten the reading sitation changed. It is always announced as Isaiah 35 but it is actually Isaiah 9.
</p>
<p>Well, we have some work to do and our final park of the evening.</p>

<p>Today we walked around the neighborhood. I totally missed Pine Street on the other side of 3rd. I will have to re-educate Elwood that this is not a pedestrian mall as I had originally indicated. I figured it out when we had walked too far and then came to North Main.
</p>
<p>We are still working on the park issue. At the curb is working best and will be more practical long term. We just couldn't practice at the Seeing Eye. It's the moves which we could have practiced along with the cars, stationary and otherwise, we we couldn't practice. Elwood is eating though I cut back his food since we are not on school schedule so sooner or later something has to happen.
</p>
<p>We went to the 5 o'clock service. Elwood thought it was quite peculiar that I wanted him to turn right after the building and didn't understand that the sidewalk with steps was his goal. I am teaching him to lay under the pew. Elwood was not thrilled about this. I spent a lot of the service putting him back in position. Fortunately, Episcopalians believe in assigned seats so I will be able to teach Elwood where to sit.</p>
