<p>When I untied Elwood this morning in preparation for going out, he began dashing wildly about, up and down the hall. Up onto the braille printer, hitting the form feed button. Back down the hall and back, knocking over the floor lamp. Another turn and more paper spewed forth. Finally, the leash was attached and he made it out in the knick of time.
</p>
<p>Upon his return to the apartment, he continued to be excited. fortunately, none of his restlessness  was destructive. He simply had trouble settling down to go to his place so I could start preparing his breakfast.
</p>
<p>Once he was fed, he was his gentle self.
</p>
<p>I guess that's what happens when you don't poop at dinnertime or bedtime. You're raring to go the next morning in more ways than one.</p>

<p>It continues to be <strong>very</strong> cold here, single digits at best with wind chills -20. Elwood shivers a lot. I keep trying different gloves for ones that will keep my hands warm and ones that will let me buckle the harness without taking them off. These do not tend to be the same gloves.
</p>
<p>We were able to get out and go for lunch. Elwood was excited to get some work in and behaved well at the restaurant. His guide work was very good, too.
</p>
<p>After dinner--Elwood's, that is--the power went out. I hadn't had supper. Elwood didn't understand why I wasn't putting the lights back on. My apartment dropped 2 degrees in 20 minutes. The power was out for about a half an hour. The radio on the a.m. band in this area was out, too. Philadelphia was coming in loud and clear which wasn't helpful at all. I understand the local fm station was on, but I couldn't pick it out from the rest.
</p>
<p>Elwood is starting to get the hang of curling up under the table. The other day I called him but he didn't come. I called several times with corrections. Still no Elwood but much noise. I went to see what he was up to. He had gotten tangled in the speaker wires and was stuck. We straightened that out and he happily came with me.</p>

<p>It continues to snow here and be very, very cold--single digits on the radio this morning. The lack of sidewalk shoveling also continues. In areas there is salt so there is slush. The salt really bothers Elwood, getting into his pads.
</p>
<p>Today we needed to run an errand. Elwood is getting the hang of this snow ting and walking where the snow has been trodden down, pretending that there is a sidewalk.
</p>
<p>I would think making downtown walkable in bad weather would enhance the downtown area but no one else puts this idea into action.
</p>
<p>I have also discovered a trick of Elwood's and I am trying to put a stop to it. When I come in, I had been unharnessing him and letting him dash off while I got my coat and boots off. No longer. He is required to wait until I get undressed before his harness comes off. Then he is sent to his place because ... Elwood has been dashing into the kitchen and jumping up onto the counter while I was at the door and couldn't see him.</p>

<p>It's very cold today in Jamestown and is supposed to get into the single digits tonight. As a result, the snow is still here and it keeps flurrying.
</p>
<p>Elwood was excited to go somewhere this morning. He puts it into low gear, that is, he pulls very hard but isn't going particularly fast as if he is down shifting. He did fairly well turning at the corner of Main and 3rd though he had trouble finding the up ramp. We just went over the curb on the Main Street side. Not his fault. There's snow covering the curb.
</p>
<p>A woman driving down Main Street stopped to tell me he was holding his left foot up. She thought it might be cold. I think it may have had some salt in between his pads. The walk around the bank and the street were very gritty.
</p>
<p>Eric was shoveling when I got to church. Their curb has been very clear.
</p>
<p>I put the gentle leader on. Elwood stayed down for most of the service, even during anointing for healing. Very impressive.
</p>
<p>He also settled down nicely for Bible study without it on. Maybe he's getting this church thing a little.
</p>
<p>Our walk home went well. He's starting to figure out where the curbs ought to be on the return trip at 4th and 3rd. He was still proceeding in low gear.</p>

<p>More snow on the way tomorrow. Today we took it easy so far as sallying forth.
</p>
<p>Yesterday I went to the mailbox. We walked past City hall. I thought that might be clear. It isn't always. Unfortunately, USPS doesn't think its patrons will be using the boxes on 2nd street. They were not clear of snow though you could open them. Obviously the public continues to mail letters. I'm finally getting back into netflix so I had an envelope to mail.
</p>
<p>Crossing Prendergast at 2nd is not clear so I went up to 3rd thinking that would be better. It's another rounded curb. I thought I had it right. I thought Elwood's hesitation was about the large puddle. Maybe it was. Labs will jump in the lake but get their feet wet in a puddle! You've got to be kidding.
</p>
<p>Then the traffic was all wrong. Getting onto the sidewalk was all wrong. The sidewalk wasn't as clear but then we weren't up against the building. The street crossing at Spring had a lot more traffic than usual, more trucks. The sidewalk wasn't at all what is in front of our building and we didn't get to Pine Street. Oh, we crossed 3rd instead of Prendergast.
</p>
<p>No problem. We'll just take the long way home.
</p>
<p>It wasn't until I was standing at Spring that I realized the traffic flow was wrong for 4th Street. They are each one way streets--in different directions. We were at 5th. Oh yeah! That street we crossed wasn't at City Hall. It was 4th St. across from the Jackson Center. No problem.
</p>
<p>Well, I don't know ... somehow we lost the sidewalk. There was this railing. We went inland. We came back out. Elwood thought we should continue but the street felt very close. Perhaps it was the street. Anyway, traffic moves along at a good clip on 5th and there were a lot of trucks. We'll go back to Spring.
</p>
<p>Happily Spring was fairly clear but as we approached 4th, I remembered the sidewalk there is a little goofy. It's goofy at 3rd, too. We'll go down to Main.
</p>
<p>We crossed Pine. I heard someone calling my name.
</p>
<p>A long lost friend came up. She had seen me on Prendergast--remember Prendergast. She didn't think that was right so she had been driving around with all the one way streets, looking for a place to park, to check in with me. Not the first time someone has done this.
</p>
<p>We got to catch up. it was really fine and she reminded me where I was so we could go home. Elwood and she were very appropriate which made the visit even more enjoyable.</p>

<p>No, not that spring! It's 20 something outside, snow-covered and probably more snow on the way. The lake isn't frozen and has to get another 10 degrees colder in order to freeze.
</p>
<p>The spring I'm talking abut is the one that causes Elwood to jump up. He was especially springy at church on Saturday. I didn't think about his gentle leader. This week was much springier than last so it will become pro forma to have him wear it.
</p>
<p>The gentle leaders are worn much tighter. I think it has something to do with pressure points. It's supposed to calm the dog. Calm in church would be good.
</p>
<p>Sunday we went out. I stood at the curb. Elwood did his thing off the curb. All was going well until Elwood bounced on long leash. There was a pole and me and him and then I was down. Despite the snow, sidewalks are hard. Elwood was a bit surprised but not upset. I got up. We got ourselves back together again.
</p>
<p>So far, we haven't had a repeat which is very good.
</p>
<p>I transferred the big bag of food into the new plastic container with locking lid. Elwood couldn't resist an open bag of dog food so I'm pleased the new container holds it all. I can lift a full container, too, so can put it up where he can't figure out how to open it. I don't know if he can figure it out but I don't want to know.</p>

<p>Elwood really likes being curled up between my feet. No climbing. No poking at my hands bone in mouth while I try to use the keyboard. I will end of using this laptop computer in my lap.
</p>
<p>Yesterday I put him on tie down while I talked with someone. He whimpered and fussed until I settled him down. Then he was quiet, for about an hour. He is getting to be like most people--a service lasts an hour so at the end of that time, let's get on with it.
</p>
<p>Elwood did very well this morning by identifying the street despite the snow covering. This is very gratifying. I depend on my dog to identify walks and streets when they are snow-covered or poorly defined. He's really coming along.</p>

<p>Safe streets have taken on a whole new meaning to me this week. We did not get the snowstorm of many inches of snow that was coming this way. Instead, we got an inch or thereabouts which basically means it's inconvenient to walk around town.
</p>
<p>Today, being clear though cold, I bundled up in hat, scarf and gloves to take Elwood out. While out, I decided a walk would be possible given that no percipitation was falling.
</p>
<p>We walked down Pine Street. Clear in spots but very icy in others. We turned at 2nd. The same. We walked up Main. Not bad. When we got to 3rd, Elwood made a quick right-hand turn back to the apartment. I had planned to walk up to 4th, but well, if he wasn't interested ... When we crossed Pine, it was clear to me Elwood was planning on going home.
</p>
<p>I don't know if Elwood just thought I was disoriented and took the long way home or wether he judged the streets to be unsafe. In the first case, I'm dumb. In the second, he's smart. Elwood didn't worked in snow  as part of his training. He may just think it is an aboration to be endured before better working conditions materialize. He could be right.</p>

<p>On Saturday we were able to get out and walk. If the rain we have had was turned into snow, I don't think we would dig out until June. Elwood did very well on our walk, down 2nd, up Prendergast, across on 4th and back down Main to 3rd. He did think Potter's Alley might be the route off of 4th, but that is, as Patience once remarked, a better endeavor with a skate board than a dog.
</p>
<p>It was damp, nasty and cold by the time we went to church. I tried something new---putting the gentle leader on Elwood during the service. I also used the flexi lead to continue to get him (and me) used to it. He was relatively good though the Peace continues to be an opportunity to stand with the pack. I'm not standing at all at this point, focusing instead on keeping him down. 
</p>
<p>When we got to Communion, Elwood decided to investigate the pew cushions. Ok. Laying across the pew cushions isn't great but if he's quiet ... Taking the cup in my right hand is an adventure. I can't even find my mouth with my right hand. Fortunately, the assisting minister is well-trained and neither lets go of the cup nor hesitates to guide the cup to my mouth. And then, Elwood flops to the floor in perfect form, jerking my whole body. Wine splashes on my face, my sweater. Someone is now seeing if they can get the wine out of my sweater.
</p>
<p>After the service, someone comes over to offer a ride home because of the inclement conditions. No, we'll walk. It's not snowing. It's not really raining, just misting, and it is more complicated to accept a ride than walk.
</p>
<p>We leave the church and Elwood finds the good folks getting into their car. He dashes over. Did I want a ride after all? Well, apparently, Elwood understood more of the conversation than I thought. Time to refocus Elwood on his work.
</p>
<p><strong>Rant:</strong> And then there was the girl at the corner of 3rd and Main when we were going to church who bounces across Main and says, Hi, Puppy! and Elwood jumps on her. I'm trying to position myself at the rounded ramp to cross 3rd. I have a dog who now lunges out into the street. Stop! Let's get re situated here. Let's check traffic again. Why do people talk to my dog? 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Friends.</li>
<li>Strangers.</li>
<li>People who should know better.</li>
<li>People who I have told repeatedly not to talk to my dog.</li>
<li>People who don't know either me or my dog.</li>
</ul>
It's like messing with someone's car or kid or partner. It's that invasive. <strong>End Rant</strong>
<p>We went shopping. Elwood wants to be a shopper, sample the merchandise. He removed a button from a pillow. Sniffed everything and everybody. Went down aisles he wasn't told to investigate.
</p>
<p>I've decided his question is more <q>What's that?</q> than <q>I want it.</q> He decided to jump up to the counter to check out my 9-grain loaf of bread. I am becoming convinced that crate-training dogs is a mixed blessing. It means they don't have to behave while you're cooking, while you're eating.
</p>
<p>So far, we've missed the big storm. I went out tonight and there was a covering on the walks but not on the streets. I lost the poop bag--with the poop in it, so if you come across a teal plastic bag ... toss it!
</p>
<p>I went to put Elwood's bell on him. I like this bell. I can hear him. It wasn't on the bookshelf by the door. Thinking it had fallen, I got down on the floor. Elwood thought we might be playing. He licked my ear, then nipped it. Ouch! I'm not available for that. I found his bell on my dresser.
</p>
<p>Elwood had a few minutes of puppy aerobics, racing around wildly, wondering if he could engage me, especially my fingers. He is none too gentle so I keep track of his teeth and my proximity to them.
</p>
<p>The other night, Elwood tried to lay down in my lap. This is very hard to do if not impossible. I tried sitting in the upholstered rocker. He settled in with his back feet on the floor. I was finally able to convince him to lay between my feet on the floor. This satisfies him greatly. Today I showed him it is possible to do this at the table, too. It is quite fine to sit with a dog curled between your feet.
</p>
<p>Right now he is chomping quite enthusiastically on one of his bones. A lot of energy to burn on yet another miserable evening.</p>

<p>When I woke up this morning, the radio said it was 14 degrees. Brr.
</p>
<p>This was Elwood's first real test of working in snow. Curbs are hard to find. It is icy in places.
</p>
<p>He moves fast so I had to concentrate on slowing him down. Secondly, I had to find the curbs. I was doing okay for a while, then we had a crossing or two where Elwood had veered. This is not all his fault. The curb cuts are not always one for each street but at the point, one ramp for the two right angled streets and these are difficult for dogs. 
</p>
<p>We went to a favorite restaurant of mine. It was Elwood's first trip. We found the restaurant okay. We sat at a table by the window. The server removed a chair so Elwood would have plenty of room. He wanted to sit up and look out the window. So long as he didn't wiggle, I allowed it. He wasn't bothering anyone. On the way home we had trouble picking up one of the curb cuts and had to wade through some snow to cross. A bit sloppy but as I always say: No honking horns, no screeching of brakes, no broken glass. We were fine.
</p>
<p>Elwood is still having difficulty understanding that in church people move around but he is to stay still.</p>
