<p>I have really struggled with writing my next Ronnie Camberwell mystery. I was so pleased with myself about exploring magic, but magic has proved to be difficult. Magic has a cost and although I have figured out what the cost is to Ronnie as a result of her careless attitude toward magic, I cannot figure out the cost of magic to the wizard on an ongoing basis. The wizards are just gifted with the ability to perform magic and beyond that, I don't know what to do.</p>
<p>I've explored the political consequences and that doesn't seem to hold water. Exile would break a society apart. Inherited magic doesn't make sense either. </p>
<p>So I don't have a good reason for wizards to have the ability to do magic to hang out together in the Magic Lands.</p>
<p>In my mind, the Magic Lands feel very medieval. Perhaps this is just a trope. On the other hand, I have always felt there is something cinister about the place, as if it itself is held fast by a very powerful spell. Who does the work around here? Are they slaves?</p>
<p>There is just no energy or enthusiasm to write this story.  I might have to recast it and I started to do this by introducing Captain Star Runner into the plot line. I want to develop something which involves these two characters to write regularly this winter.</p>

<p>Today Nick and I celebrate our second anniversary.</p>
<p>Nick and I had a rocky start. I was originally matched with a different dog, Chance. Chance did everything I asked to do except go fast. I decided I didn't want to bring a dog home that would likely slow down and then I would be very frustrated. I asked for a new dog.</p>
<p>Chance left in the morning. I went to lunch dogless. At lunch I learned one of the other students had to leave class due to an injury. I even passed him as he was leaving.</p>
<p>In my room, my instructor brought my dog to me. I was in love immediately--a yellow Labrador Retriever male--big and beautiful.</p>
<p>"Full disclosure," my instructor said. "This was Stanley's dog."</p>
<p>I have always felt badly that in order to get Nick Stanley had to get hurt. If only he had received Chance and I was initially paired with Nick.</p>
<p>I don't know what this was all about-- Do things happen for a reason? Well, I've always been glad Nick was not paired with a newby.</p>
<p>Nick has always been a difficult dog.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nick doesn't like obedience. He remains a toddler. "Why?" Why do your want me to sit now? Why must I lay down? Once Nick figures this out for imself, he is quite willing to do so. He has finally figured that when people get up at the Sharing of the Peace at church, we are not preparing to leave the service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nick continues to be difficult to park. We go out. Nick does number one. Then Nick often is willing to start to go inside. Then he will literally make a U-turn and return to the grass for number two.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nick came home with an ear infection. I treated that. Soon afterwards, Nick's foot became infected. Licking. Licking. Licking. The vet decided he had a condition called Canine Atopic Dermatitis. I think of it as itching from the inside out. They tell me it is genetic. He is on a grain free diet which I must supplement with canned pumpkin and a laxative. My initial problems parking Nick may have been caused by Nick being so uncomfortable on grass. It is still amazing to me that Nick worked as well as he did with his medical issues.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Nick still goes fast. He has never slowed down. He marks his territory, sniffs poles, gets distracted by other dogs. I often wonder if he was a C student. He learns slowly.</p>
<p>All this said, I never thought about returning him. He was my forever dog.</p>
<p>He is working here in the city, on buses, vans and busy city streets. He can see a route once and follow many turns inside a busy building. He is learning to talk to me about needing to park, about an empty water bowl and a late dinner. He is exploring talking to me when it is time to get up.</p>
<p>This is a happy day.</p>

<p>A number of years ago my niece, Barbara, described me as one of the funniestpeople  she knew. (I took her to mean humorous rather than peculiar.) About that timefriends  started saying to me, "You ought to write a book," when I related a recent event in my life. I laughed and replied, "Do you really think so?" and then let the matter drop.</p>
<p>Some time later I became aware of the proliferation of the memoir. These books appeared to be extreme accounts of abuse or storiesfilled with juicy sexual details. I always got the impression critics despised them as they were not painstakingly written autobiographies replete with much deep reflection and soul searching.</p>
<p>I was soured on the idea of writing a memoir by Elizabeth Gilbert and Eat Pray Love. Gilbert is an award winning freelance journalist and author. She was given a $200,000 publisher's advance to write the book. The book did not grow out of Her travels but was intended from the first.</p>
<p>Although a nationally known journalist, Beth Finke's Writing Out Loud gave me a helpful perspective on what my own memoir might look like. Finke's piecesn are short incidents strung together over a number of years. They are satisfying because they feature recurring characters and their stories. Although there is an over-arching narrative of setting up writers' groups for older adults and Finke's anxiet yabout leading them, we are treated tomany satisfying vignettes.</p>
<p>My other struggle with meoir is storytelling itself. My mother, and undoubtedly her mother before her, were magnificent storytellers in their own right. Their talent went unremarked. Even my grandmother's brother could spin quite a yarn. Uncle Arthur only had an eighth grade education and wrote without capitalization or punctuation. He always concluded letters to Gram with "your brudder," and did not sign his name. There were, after all, only the two of them. Who else would the letter be from? Uncle Arthur also was known for sending his sister unsigned birthday cards. The printed card had "to my sister" on the front.</p>
<p>I learned to tell stories about the dinner table. Our custom was to recount the events of each day. We went in order: first my dad, then my mom, then me and finally my younger sister. Everyone was heard.</p>
<p>When I was thirteen, I won a creative writing contest. Mother insisted I call up one of the neighbors. His daughter was in my 4-H Club. I had visions of grandeur, writing novels about a life far more exciting and adventuresome than mine. Nat Hartshorne counseled me to write about myself. I could not imagine writing about that for over fifty years.</p>
<p>I am good in conversation to craft a retelling of an every day event in my own life. It might go something like this:</p>
<p>So there I was, standing on the corner. I knew I had the light and needed to give Nick the command to start across the street when I heard this siren. It was coming fast. I knew that vehicle was not going to stop for the light and, in truth, it did not. I stayed on the curb and waited for the next cycle before crossing."</p>
<p>My conversation partners thrill astounded. I perceive the world differently than they do. They try and fail to put themselves in my place. And yet, all I have done is said I waited for an emergency vehicle to pass.</p>
<p>I speak or write about myself in three to four sentence bursts. Longer essays illude me. They need context, background information and organization.</p>
<p>In high school, Mr. Cook read T. S. Eliot's poem, The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufroc to us. At one point in the poem Prufrock says, </p>
<p>No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;†</p>
<p>Am an attendant lord, one that will do†</p>
<p>To swell a progress, start a scene or two,†</p>
<p>Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,†</p>
<p>Deferential, glad to be of use,†</p>
<p>Politic, cautious, and meticulous;†</p>
<p>Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;†</p>
<p>At times, indeed, almost ridiculous--†</p>
<p>Almost, at times, the Fool.</p>
<p>In short, Prufrock describes himselfas  not importan. He has a role to play and he plays it.</p>
<p>This is how I think about my memoir pieces. I am the only one who can tell these stories, but the stories I tell are not overly importantt.</p>

<p>Getting Organized
I did not write yesterday. Even though my plan was to write every day, the only thing I wrote was a list of things to write today.</p>
<p>What I did do was purchase <a href="https://red-sweater.com">MarsEdit</a> so that I can fully access my [micro.blog(https://rill.micro.blog). The iOS app is not fully accessible; neither is the web site. This makes editing my posts difficult if not impossible after they are posted. With <a href="https://red-sweater.com">MarsEdit</a> I can work on my Mac and fix any mistakes.</p>
<p>What I did not realize initially was that my blog posts were in plain text. My markdown was not working because I had not set up an "About" page. I will have to make sure they are now properly formatted.</p>
<p>I am still pretty shaky with MarsEdit. I hope I can become more proficient in the future.</p>
<p>I am trying to write this post using my Braille display. It is quite hard at the moment because I am using</p>
<ul>
<li>a new app * my Mac * andthe Braille display</li>
</ul>
<p>I am shaky using the Braille display connected to the Mac and I haven't consulted the documentation. Soon I will have to look up how to control the Mac with this device.</p>
<p>Later ... Markdown is working on the site. I used different ways of indicating unordered lists and different strategies for posting so the lists look different even in the same post:<em> simple lists * white bullets</em> and regular bullets In any case, MarsEdit is working with my blog <a href="posts/2018/04/08/505/rill.micro.blog">rill.micro.blog</a>. #BlogEveryDay</p>

<p>It has been another day at home</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>no appointments</li>
<li><p>very cold weather</p></li>
<li><p>lots of odds and ends to do</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So what exactly did I do today?

</p>

<ul>
<li>I created my shopping list in the Pick and Save app. Although it makes more sense to make a list instead of adding my items to the shopping cart, (I won't checkout from the cart.), the app is set up to add to the cart and it is an extra step, as far as I can tell, to add something to the shopping list. The cool thing about the shopping list is that you can check off the item presumably when you put it into your cart.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think I am buying more because I am able to peruse the store.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I recorded a quick demo of the <em>Tunein Live</em> Alexa skill for the Dot To Dot podcast. It is a paid skill with a 7-day free trial. It gives me access to Tunein premium content. I pay for this on my phone. (I pay a premium there.) It is a lot cheaper on my Amazon Echo. I started Tunein Premium originally because I had access to a variety of audio books as part of my subscription. I figured if I read a book a month I broke even. The books have been dropped from the program and I have been meaning to cancel my subscription. I can get my baseball games, but it is cheaper to use my dedicated MLB subscription. Besides, the baseball stream on my phone was not as reliable as the dedicated app. So why would I want to pay for <em>Tunein Live</em>? I can stream some premium stations like Aljazeera English, C-Span and Young Turks.  It is far more likely that I will stream these at home rather than when I am out and about. I do drop into a baseball game when I have some down time when I am away from home.</p></li>
<li><p>I did the laundry. Laundry is manageable when the machines are in your home. When they are coin-operated and downstairs, they are barely tolerable. There is coming and going, setting timers and discovering that half the machines are out-of-order.</p></li>
<li><p>I caught up with a young friend from guide dog school. It was good to hear her voice over audio messages.</p></li>
<li><p>I posted to Facebook to see how other guide dog handlers find bus stop poles. They mostly assured me that my dog would catch on if I use the bus frequently which I currently do not do. If I get the route to <a href="https://vision-forward.ord">Vision Forward</a> down, this may be the case. Whether Nick will start recognizing bus poles out in the wild remains to be seen.</p></li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p>One of my #BlogEveryDay goalssis to work on my Varioultra Braille Display and learn how to use it as a stand alone device. One of the display's strengths is the ability to copy and paste text from the notetaker into a text field on my iPhone or iPad. Unfortunately, the Unified English Braille translation is poor. 
<em> Periods translate as "dd".
</em> Random periods are written after the "with", "and" and "for" contractions. 
<em> The "</em>" becomes "in.</p>
<p>So I have switched to using the Braille display directly with my iPhone. We will see how this goes. I am still committed to using Unified English Braille rather than Grade 2 Braille. I figure that all new Braille will be in Unified English Braille and I want it solidly in my brain as I age. 
One of the fun things that came about using an app with markdown. I clicked on the preformatted link shortcut. I learned the left and right bracket signs in UEB as well as re-learning how to properly form a link. Everything looks different in Braille. That is what I get for spending my time writing markdown in Emacs on Linux.</p>

<p>Today I worked with my mobility instructor to understand how to take the bus to <a href="http://vision-forward.org">Vision Forward</a>. I was relieved to learn that the bus stop near my apartment is easy to find. Both Nick and I were disappointed that I did not bring "you found the pole" treats with me. Blame the cold weather. The treats were in a lighter weight jacket.</p>
<p>As my instructor had another appointment after mine, I elected not to take the bus to the transfer point but to have him drive us there.</p>
<p>I get off the bus at the corner and then I have a choice:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>I can cross a busy street to get to the next bus stop. (There is a shelter there.)</li>
<li><p>I can walk down a fairly long block to find another bus stop. It is right at the cornerand very easy to find.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If the weather is good and there is time, walking a block sounds like a very easy solution to me. It also gives Nick a chance to relieve himself if necessary. Crossing busy streets is not always a comfortable option. It means listening very carefully to traffic changing direction when the light changes. With my moderate hearing loss in one ear (corrected by a hearing aid), I do not hear as well as I once did. Sometimes it is hard to pick up the surge of traffic and therefore have the full cycle to cross the street.

Afterwards, we simulated getting off the bus coming home from <a href="http://visionccforward.org">Vision Forward</a>.

Nick was doing well, but he wanted to check the bus shelter and was not particularly interested in finding the pole. Again, I could not bribe him with treats. I suspect he will come through on the day I actually make the trip.

I am looking forward to conquering this trip as I plan to be a frequent visitor to <a href="http://vision-forward.org">Vision Forward</a>. I can take Paratransit at a higher cost. This means sharing rides and possibly spending much more time onboard.</p>

<p>Today is Election Day in Wisconsin. My polling place is in my Community Room. No excuses. Go and vote in the Spring Election.</p>
<p>In the past, I have been very timid going into a new situation. Somewhere along the line, I have become more bold. I walked in and said, to no one in particular, "Hello." A woman directed me to someone who could help me register. I explained I was new to the city and needed to transfer my registration from another city in the state. Shockingly, I needed only to have lived for ten consecutive days at my current address. I am used to needing to live forty days in the county. I needed to show my ID and give my former address. I signed two papers:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>My new registration</li>
<li><p>Because my name was not in the book, the paper was necessary.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I decided not to have someone fill out my ballot for me. I used the talking voting machine for the first time. It took a little while to set it up. It is not used often.

I now know to bring my own wired headphones. I had to use the provided ones and the sanitation issues could be a concern. I had to adjust the volume and the speed of the speech. I wanted it loud and fairly slow so I could really understand what I was doing. This is an election after all.

Here in Wisconsin, we use paper ballots. The ballot is fed into the machine and there is a pause. I assume the machine is scanning the ballot.

After everything was set up, I listened to the instructions. The buttons are different shapes and large. Controls are labeled in Braille. I used a right arrow to move from contest to contest. I used the up and down arrows to review my selections. When I was done with each contest, I pressed the square button which is labeled with an s for select.

At the end, I had a chance to review my choices and hit the final select button.

There was a significant amount of clanking while the machine actually marked the ballot and then spit it out. After that, I just needed to insert it into the slot to be counted.

I left the poll with a "I voted" sticker, making sure it was right side up.

The poll worker remarked that we could at least get the sticker right side up because so much else in the world was up side down.

I wondered that she made such a reference. I did not think election workers could make any such comments.

When I was five I went with my mother to vote. The voting machines were mechanical. You step into the booth, close the curtain and pull down the levers associated with each of the candidates you want. When you are finished, you slide the curtain back. There is a wonderful mechanical sound as the votes are tallied. At the end of the day, the poll officials will open the back and get the vote count for each machine. I once brought two kids, one guide dog and mzf into the booth. That was certainly chummy.

Back to 1956.

A state trooper wasalw on duty at the polling place. (I don't know if Wisconsin has a police presence. I will have to inquire.) I knew the trooper. I went to school with his daughter. I went up to him and opened my coat in order to show him all the election buttons I was wearing.

This caused a commotion. Displaying the buttons is considered electioneering at the polls which is illegal so I had to close my coat very quickly.

I am certain one of the buttons was "I Like Ike". I have no idea what the others were. #BlogEveryDay</p>

<p>I think I have spent an hour this morning trying to work out why my iPhone was not speaking. Here is what I tried:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>I rebooted the iPhone several times.</li>
<li><p>I connected my Braille display and VoiceOver was working. If it was not on, the Braille display would not work. I turned VoiceOver on and off via Siri several times. When I turned VoiceOver off with the Braille display connected, my display on the Braille notetaker went blank.</p></li>
<li><p>I went into the Sound Settings and found the volume was at an acceptable level. I raised and lowered it. I was able to do this because VoiceOver spoke on this screen. When I left the sound settings screen, VoiceOver stopped speaking.</p></li>
<li><p>I went through all the VoiceOver settings. I could find nothing wrong. After all, the iPhone worked just fine when I plugged it in to charge before I went to bed.</p></li>
<li><p>I played with the mute switch. (I never remember which way is mute and which way is unmuted.) Unfortunately, the Internet does not tell you which way to click the mute switch to be unmuted. The only description I found referred to a red or orange strip which becomes visible when unmuted.</p></li>
<li><p>I searched the web. Nothing I found was particularly useful.</p></li>
<li>
<p>I tried to play an audio file. I heard nothing. This alarmed me. All sound was turned off somehow.</p>
<p>My phone turned off. I woke it up and reviewed the lock screen. I noticed information about my bluetooth headphones. Didn't I read something about this before? Why were my headphones coming up here anyway? They are in my pocketbook. I have not taken them out for days.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I went to find my bag.

I could hear the. audio file still playing. The problem resolved itself immediately: Sound was being directed through my headphones rather than through my speaker. I turned off the headphones and voila, sound came back to my iPhone. Why hadn't I thought of this before? It has happened before.

I did not think of it because I hadn't used the headphones for almost a week and my phone had worked fine yesterday. What changed?

If the crate belonged to my previous guide dog, I would blame Elwood. He was a sneak and. a cheat and I loved him dearly. Turning on my headphones by bumping my bag would have seemed just good fun to him. But Nick does not have that sort of humor. There is nothing sneaky about Nick at all. #BlogEveryDay</p>

<p>Today is Easter. This is a happy day. Unfortunately, it is colddd</p>
<p>Yesterday I bundled up to walk up Holy Hill with my family. The temperature was in the. forties. It rained earlier in the morning, but cleared a little laterdd</p>
<p>We wanted to go to a Vietnamese restaurant. Sadly, it was closed and. the building is for rent. Although the food there was good, the facility was run down and not inviting to the public. It was probably under capitalized as welldd</p>
<p>S we started looking for. another place to eat since we all were quite hungry. The first restaurant we tried was very busy. They invited us to eat on the unheated enclosed patio. This was not an option for us. There were high tops and. the room was gloomy. It might be acceptable later in the yeardd</p>
<p>Restaurants were pretty slim on the ground, but we found a custard place. Not being from Wisconsin native, I imagined a custard place to be just about ice cream. I did not realize these are regular restaurants that are known for burgers. Happily for me, they also serve deep fried cod and good French fries. The triple scoop Hot Fudge Heaven Sunae is excellent. It comes without whipped cream. I learned in college when I lived in western Pennsylvania that whipped cream is not a part of. a traditional Sundae. And. the decaf coffee is perfectdd</p>
<p>Walking the Stations of. the Cross is supposed to be a reverent, meditative and solemn experience. I went with. an eight-year-old and. a four-year-old. It was loud, energetic and involved running and shrieking. Reading the name of each station meant screaming the words rather than speaking loudly. Nick, my Seeing Eye dog, thought that copying the kids' actions was the way to go so my "walk" up Holy Hill had a lot of jerks and swerves in it. Some of. the hills are steep. The blacktop is in good shape, but the drop offs are fairly steep. I was nervous I would trip or step off the side and fall down the hilldd</p>
<p>Then came the stairs. The stairs are well-maintained like the rest of. the path. There are handrails. The stairs, too, are steep. The first set of stairs is about a story high -- thirteen steps. The second set of stairs is thirty-three steps, one for each year of Jesus' earthly lifedd</p>
<p>We found the stations we missed on our earlier visit in the fall. They commemorate Jesus' burialdd</p>
<p>If I thought yesterday was chilly, today is down right wintry. I sut on my knitted headband, my light weight gloves and my winter coat. I also wore a sweater because the downstairs hall is at the church is very cooldd</p>
<p>I put on my new jeans, but Amazon sent me regular length ones instead of petite. I reordered using Alexa. This is disappointing. I won't go through the hassle of returning them. Perhaps my daughter-in-law will be able to hem them or at the very least cut them off. They are a little roomy too, but they are still unwashed. I need to use a lot of heat to dry my clothes since apartment coin operated dryers are not known for their nuanced drying capabilitiesdd</p>
<p>I planned to attend the pot luck after church at a nearby home. I packed the challah bread I bought yesterday and. a frozen pound of butter in a backpack. Off we wentdd</p>
<p>When we were approaching East Dewy Place, Nick stopped. I checked for. the curb. Instead of finding the down curb, I found the sidewalk missing. Very carefully, I tried to determine the depth of. the missing sidewalk section, mindful that this could be a deep hole. Nick has no way to indicate this. I have been known to be over confident in the past and almost get myself into real trouble by freelancing on my own. I quickly hit dirt, but decided against seeing if it was only one missing section I needed to negociate. There was construction debris around udd</p>
<p>Early in the week, on our way home from the dentist, some trucks were working across the street further south. I thought this construction might be relateddd</p>
<p>We backtracked and went around the block. I crossed East Dewy Place, hoping we would be able to get back on the sidewalk. No luck. We wound up on dirt and later on the street. It took me a little time to figure this out and work Nick carefully along the side of. the street. Nick seemed uncertain how to proceed. Perhaps I was too bossy and did not give him room to work. This is often one of my failings as a guide dog user. We worked sideways until we arrived back at the sidewalk. I did not execute this as well as I would like. My explanation is that I did not assess the situation properly. The good news is that only local traffic is allowed on the street and few cars traveled pastdd</p>
<p>Th meant a much bigger rerouting. We walked over to South Chase Street. Nick offered to take me to the dentist. We walked along East Oklahoma. and crossed it when the Milwaukee County Transit bus crossed. With. a detour down South Adams Avenue to investigate another dog, we arrived at church nearly halfway through the servicedd</p>
<p>The highlight of. the morning was Dick's adult baptism. I did not miss that. There was a reception afterwardsdd</p>
<p>Sitting with friends, coffee and. a light lunch, I described my adventure. A ride home appeared. I gratefully took it. I sent the bread to the pot luck. I was exhausted after the longer than usual walk and. the stress of two detours.</p>
