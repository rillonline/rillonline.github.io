I am reconstituting this blog with posts that date back twenty years. It's a daunting task but also amusing, boring, delightful and surprising all at the same time.
Today I found an outline of an ebook I started to write on <code>orgmode</code>.
I don't have all the files for it, but I want to find what I have and relearn how to use this powerful mode again. The best I can do is have a tag page for it!.I may need to update the files as I will definitely get a chance to find out how well I described what to do.

<p>
***Narrative
</p>

<p>
You can skip this part if you only want to know how to get sending mail
working on your pi.
</p>

<p>
There was a person who contributed to Hacker Public News (I think they
used a fictional character's name) who once wrote that all instructions
on the Internet had incorrector missing information in their tutorials.
I certainly have found this to be true in this extended saga.
</p>

<p>
In my physical space, I have a pi at a computer stand on one side of the
room and a ChromeBook on the other. I did a lot of walking back and
forth. I use the ChromeBook to search the Internet and copy items of
interest. Now when I search, I always get an AI overview. In general, I
find these overviews to give me the information I need, but not this
time. The information was often outdated or incorrect.
</p>

<p>
I have also come to the conclusion that pages on the ArchLinux wiki do
not first give you the basics but are delighted to give you lots of
other things you can do without stressing what you actually need to get
up and running.
</p>

<p>
Finally, it often takes me a while to realize what part of the examples
are required text and which are placeholders.
</p>

<p>
Take for example the line:
</p>

<p>
<code>account gmail</code>
</p>

<p>
In this case, <code>gmail</code> is an arbitrary name. I could put <code>squirrel</code> or
<code>arugala</code> even when I am defining a <code>gmail</code> account.
</p>

<p>
I have spent days searching, installing, uninstalling and puzzling over
errors. Rince and repeat.
</p>

<p>
OK, on to the way to get it working.
</p>

<p>
***Introduction
</p>

<p>
I wanted a way to move some files off of my raspberry pi onto cloud services like OneDrive and Dropbox. Instead of configuring <code>rclone</code> or a similar service, I figured an email attachment would work just as well. (I totally forgot I could copy files to my PC with <code>scp</code>.) I wanted something quickly and not necessarily elegantly to get the job done.
</p>

<p>
***Installation
</p>

<p>
You need to install three programs:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>msmtp</li>

<li>msmtp-mta</li>

<li><p>
s-nail
</p>

<p>
<code>sudo pacman -S msmtp mstp-mta s-nail</code>
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
That's it! Nothing from the <code>aur</code>.
</p>

<p>
Two caviots here:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If you are using <code>gmail</code> to send your messages, you will have to create an app password for your account. Your regular password will not work.</li>

<li>I did not hide this app password in a key ring. I learned the default program <code>secret-tool</code> requires that a desktop needs to be installed. I didn't want to use <code>gpg</code> or a password manager. Is someone really going to break into my house or network and interrogate my raspberry pi to get into my <code>gmail</code>?</li>
</ol>

<p>
***The .mailrc file
</p>

<p>
Create a file named .mailrc.Include this line:
</p>

<p>
<code>set mta</code>"/usr/bin/msmtp"=
</p>

<p>
***Configure MSMTP
</p>

<p>
Create a file called <code>.msmtprc</code>.Here is the configuration file that finally worked for me. 
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org8c6a879">
auth on
tls on
tls_starttls on
tls_certcheck on
logfile ~/.msmtp.log
host smtp.gmail.com
port 587
from your-email-address
user your-email-address
password your-app-password
</pre>

<p>
This is the barebones I could get away with.
</p>

<p>
***Change File Permissions
</p>

<p>
You must change permissions on the <code>.msmtp</code> file if it contains a
password.
</p>

<p>
<code>sudo chmod 600 .msmtprc</code>
</p>

<p>
***Sending a Message
</p>

<p>
To test this configuration, I used the following command. I sent the
message to a different email account from the one I configured in <code>.msmtprc</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>echo “This is only a test.” | mail -s “Test Message" -a sending-mail.md receiving-msg-account</code>
</p>

<p>
This is one line and includes attaching this file to the email.

<p>
Today the church remembers St. Francis Navier. He wrote to Ignatius
that more evangelists were needed to tell those in Asia about Jesus.
He believed there were people just waiting to hear the good news.
Reading Psalm 62, I can say They are waiting for God alone. 
</p>

<p>
I often think of the people at the time of Jesus as waiting in
silence. Perhaps this is because of Slent Night or perhaps because we
have the Scripture about the people sitting in darkness which implies silence to me. In any event Francis reminds us that many are just waiting to hear our words of forgiveness, love and salvation.

I wrote about
[[<a href="https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2019/08/28/recurring-tasks-in-orgmode/p">https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2019/08/28/recurring-tasks-in-orgmode/p</a>][Recurring Tasks in Orgmode] previously. Once I had this to-do working properly,
I went onto the next task. I wanted to list my ideas for articles and
bigger writing projects. In my opinion, I did not need to set this all
up as a big list of to-dos. That certainly becomes overwhelming to
me.I might just stop writing altogether because the ideas keep coming
but the time and patience to write them may not be available at the
moment. I do
want to be sure I have a stash of ideas to choose from when I am able
to sit down and write out a complete article.
</p>

<p>
I created a file name "ideas.org". I inserted three headings:
</p>

<pre class="example">
* Writing Ideas Big and Small
** Blog Ideas [/]
** Bigger WRiting Projects [/]
</pre>


<p>
You may have noticed that at the end of the second level headings
there are two square brackets "[]" enclosing a slash "/". More on this
later.

<h2 id="org4067a15"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Organizing the list</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
At first I thought I would just write a list like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
- smart quotess and other typography
- less than shortcuts in orgmode
- Braile pack at public museum
- photo op with Nick
- a walk in the park with Nick
- using org capture
- Using checkboxes in org
</pre>


<p>
Then I thought about using checkboxes so I could check them off as I
went. Now this section of the file looks like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
- [ ] smart quotess and other typography
- [ ] less than shortcuts in orgmode
- [ ] Braile pack at public museum
- [ ] photo op with Nick
- [ ] a walk in the park with Nick
- [ ] using org capture
- [ ] Using checkboxes in org
</pre>


<p>
Who knows, you might even see some of these articles in the future!
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orge791daf" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge791daf"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Why Use Checkboxes?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Why use checkboxes? After all, I could simply delete the item from the
file once I published it.
</p>

<p>
It's a good point. I decided to try this methodology just to see how I
liked it and for two other reasons:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It would let me know how I was doing at keeping up with my ideas.</li>
<li>It would let me know if I needed to be thinking more about writing
opportunities.</li>
</ol>

<p>
It seems to me that a writer is stuck here: Coming up with ideas and
getting them written.

<h2 id="org437a7d5"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Using the Checkboxes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
To check off an item, press "c-c c-c" on that line. Then you have:
</p>

<p>
:- [X] Using checkboxes in org
</p>

<p>
Here's what the heading now looks like:
</p>

<pre class="example">
** Blog Ideas [1/7]
</pre>


<p>
If I turn the "/" (slash) into a percent sign (%) it looks like this:
</p>

<p>
:** Blog Ideas <code>[14%]</code> 
</p>

<p>
If I feel ambitious, I can delete these lines or I can sort them so
that all the unchecked boxes are together.

</div>
<div id="outline-container-org9685b56" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org9685b56"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> Sorting Lines</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Highlight the list</li>
<li><p>
Type "m-x sort-lines". All the checked off items will be gathered
together at the end of the list. The items appear in alphabetical
order.
</p>

<pre class="example">
- [ ] Braile pack at public museum
- [ ] a walk in the park with Nick
- [ ] less than shortcuts in orgmode
- [ ] photo op with Nick
- [ ] smart quotess and other typography
   - [ ] using org capture
- [X] Using checkboxes in org 
</pre>


<p>
This list now is in a different order than the way I originally
wrote it down. I can read through it until I come to an item with a
checkbox. I know there are no more new items.
</p></li>

<li><p>
If I want to sort in reverse order, I type: "c-u m-x sort-lines".
Here is what I now have:
</p>

<pre class="example">
- [X] Using checkboxes in org
- [ ] using org capture
- [ ] smart quotess and other typography
- [ ] photo op with Nick
- [ ] less than shortcuts in orgmode
- [ ] a walk in the park with Nick
- [ ] Braile pack at public museum
</pre>


<p>
I don't think I will use this ordering unless I need a confidence
boost. I would have to go past everything I've already done.

<p>
Nick, my Seeing Eye dog, and I took a walk this morning.
</p>

<p>
Now I know that taking a walk with your dog is not a novel experience for any dog owner. What was significant about this walk was that it took place immediately after my breakfast and before my exercise class at the senior center.
</p>

<p>
Normally I would have listened to my podcast app while sucking down at least one large cup of coffee. Instead, I skipped my morning coffee and got walking.
</p>

<p>
Our walk lasted about 40 minutes. We walked a route we just learned from our friend Sandy, but we walked it backwards. Nick trotted right along and got very excited when I chose to walk on the other side of Terrace Avenue. Nick had not walked down this side of the street yet.
</p>

<p>
I'm not sure how long the route is, maybe over 2 miles.
</p>

<p>
We have not been able to walk for several days because of our schedule and the rain. As it was not raining and it was fairly cool, it was a wonderful time to walk.

None of these work particularly well for me.
</p>

<p>
Recently I have subscribed to a verse of the day email. These can get quite boring and it is easy to read quickly, swipe and be done. The verse is almost immediately forgotten and I go on with my day.
</p>

<p>
I am not a particularly consistent journaler or blogger. That is easy enough to see. But I've decided to try again and write a little on the verse of the day as I am able and see if it can become more habitual.
</p>

<p>
One caveat: These are not "finished" essays. I'm looking for an opportunity for me to interact with the text for my own life and relationship with Jesus. If that helps you, that's great. Otherwise, just move on.
</p>

<p>
Today's verse is 2 Timothy 1:7. From the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV)
</p>

<p>
&gt; for God did not give us a spirit of cowardice, but rather a spirit of power and of love and of self-discipline.
</p>

<p>
I did a little checking. The word "cowardice" has been translated several ways. (I don't recall the Greek. You can look it up if you like. I did.)
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgce76142" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgce76142"><span class="section-number-2">8.</span> cowardice</h2>

<p>
Self-discipline has to do with sound reasoning rather than self-control.
</p>

<p>
So, if I claim to be part of the "us" rather than limiting it to Paul and Timothy, the spirit I have been given is not cowardly but powerful, loving and thinks clearly.
</p>

<p>
In today's world, we are encouraged to get along, to accept there are different points of view and to honor these differences and viewpoints. I think I do that rather well. What this text suggests to me is to not be afraid to express my own opinions and to act when the Spirit prompts me to action.
</p>

<p>
I think I can live with this and pay attention to those times when I am timid. Mostly, I do not identify myself in secular situations as Christian. I say it is because I don't want to attract the razies. I wonder if I am ignoring the spirit Jesus has given me. I'll have to test this out in the coming days.

<p>
In reading Alex's <a href="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/info/html/tutorial.html">explanation</a>, I was confused because he talks about creating a web page. This "page" (I've surrounded the word page with quotation marks.) is not something which is published on the web. It is a file a browser can read and interpret. What Alex has you do is write a file that acts as a list of bookmarks to your favorite sites so you can launch it and get around the web quickly and easily. fterI understood this, his explanations made a lot more sense.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> The extension ".org" refers to org mode not the domain type as in "raspberryvi.org". This also confused me. I thought at first org mode was not installed, but that is because I was hearing "aug" mode as in "augmented" or ""August". It's "org" as in "organized".

<p>
One of the exciting discoveries I've made says You can publish this file and there will be navigation as part of the publishing process. I'm currently reading the manual and each section of the book is a separate page with navigation to other sections built in.

<p>
I've looked at the html code generated and it is overly fussy. I'll try it with tidy and see what happens. s the code is correct, tidy has no effect.

I'm publishing the full html that was generated including the preamble and postamble. I am not sure how to disable this.

I'm waiting for my parts list so that my Raspberry Pie can be built.
Meanwhile, my USB hub and keyboard come today according to UPS.
</p>

<p>
I talked with Mike on Mangler.I now understand Raspberrian is a distro
for the pie based on Debian. It has a graphical user interface which
doesn't curently speak. I'm interested in the console and excited to
think my skills in the console will be improved if I work steadily in
Pie Land.
</p>

<p>
I'd be much happier working on my console skills than learning
emacspeak. I've done a little work with Vim and Nano and I like the
Alpine email client. I have even used Lynx to download books from the
NLS site. Mike is working on a new build so maybe the instabilities he
has noticed will be less of a factor. I hope so.

You might think that, being blind, I have no interest in paintings or other forms of visual art. You would be wrong about that. I'm fascinated
by art and what other people bring to the pictures. Last year people at
the "Stations of the Windows" Friday Lenten worship services at<a href="https://stlukesjamestown.org/">St. Luke's Jamestown</a>described the stained glass windows.
They were so enthusiastic it grew dark before we could finish the window
descriptions and the service.

Today's<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/28/arts/design/with-irreverence-and-an-ipod-recreating-the-museum-tour.html">New York Times</a> described a 
project at Marymount Manhattan College  called <a href="https://mod.blogs.com/art_mobs/">Art Mobs.</a> Even if you're not at the Museum of
Modern Art in New York City, you can download the podcasts and look at
the paintings online. I downloaded the podcast on Pablo Picasso's Les
Demoiselles d'Avignon, a Discussion by Cheryl Stoever &amp; Professor Jason
Rosenfeld.
</p>

<p>
It's rough. It's raw. It's fascinating. It's listening in on a college
professor going one on one with his student, asking her questions,
giving additional information about the painting, giving a perspective
on what the picture is about. It's just the sort of thing I want people
to tell me about art.
