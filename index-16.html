<p>The groceries arrived today. They could not be delivered yesterday because of the snowstorm. It is snowing again today and is supposed to get very, very cold. A young man came and was very helpful. The woman at the coop was also very helpful. She is sensible. When one kind of potatoes was not available, she substituted another working under the assumption I would need them. If I did't want these more expensive potatoes, I could return them. I had asked that one kind of soy milk be separated in a different bag from the other kind of soy milk. That was done. Of course one always has to figure out the bulk items and which bottle is which--salsa or salad dressing? The salad dressing came in a bottle I would have identified as Worcestershire sauce or the like but since I didn't order that, it must be the salad dressing.   I'm still guessing with items like garlic and celery--how many pounds or ounces to order. The powdered vanilla has that slightly metallic smell to it.</p>
<p>Elwood has been up to no good. He was sick the other day. Poor dog. Poor me who had to clean it up. Then, when making the bed, I discovered the problem. He had chewed up my blanket. Fortunately, I can still use he blanket, but I'm not a happy camper. At least it wasn't the down comforter. And I can't scold him either as it was some time before I realized what was chewed up though I had a suspicion it was something made from cloth.</p>

<p>Sunday we went Christmas caroling. It was a lot of driving as we visited shut-ins. It was fun singing. Also, I made a pit stop and was told it was just a room. I thought it was your typical unisex bathroom. No. It turned out this room led into another and then from there into another hallway. Elwood left and was returned. If one had wanted privacy, both doors needed to be closed?</p>
<p>We have been back to the library, after a thaw and another snowfall. Elwood is doing much better, accepting that sidewalks may be snow-covered and streets are for cars. I guess me climbing up snowbanks convinced him this methodology was highly irregular.Guide dogs do not like irregular.</p>
<p>I have spent several days working on my on line grocery list. The kids and spouses are coming for Christmas Eve dinner. There's a church service in the middle. After considering alternatives, I've decided on 3 kinds of soup. One is my grandmother's depression era potato soup. I keep thinking Gram would have found it amusing that it is a featured dish at a holiday celebration. Someone thought it was a sign of the economic times. I think it is a sign of homemade versus prepared. I will also make bread now that I understand my bread machine and have our Christmas rice pudding and fruit, both dried and fresh.</p>
<p>I decided cookies were fine for the cookie bake. I brought some home and found I wanted to eat them. I  further found this was not a good thing so they went as part of the pot luck on Wednesday night. And I decided buying all the items to bake more was too much. I also have to been concerned with a lactose intolerant guest so we're doing lots of soy and no refined sugar. Did you know you can buy vanilla flavored powder instead of vanilla extract? I've also learned about the fertilization of fig trees and the available varieties and about the production of soy milk and how it is sweetened and what muesli is. And all I wanted to do was make dinner.</p>
<p>We are expecting a big snowstorm overnight and more very cold temps. The high yesterday was 16 I think and the low -3</p>

<p>I am credited with initiating the First Annual Cookie Bake of Melanie's relatives. A good time was had by all and we also made it a cookie exchange. I baked bread now that I have mastered the bread machine and made the chicken stock for the soup we had for lunch. Elwood and the house's dog are not on good terms, but they managed to survive each other. Elwood lost his bone at J.'s and of curse, he couldn't find it and neither could we. It will surface and be brought back Christmas Eve--I hope. when we arrived back here in Madison, we went to the local  taqueria, a word meaning taco shop or restaurant. The kids were very pleased and ordered all sorts of things including a cactus casserole. The cactus was pickled. I had a dish served on a hominy-based tortilla with vegetables and cheese. Tomorrow is church and Christmas caroling in the afternoon.</p>

<p>I'm writing this from Glendale having come here on the bus yesterday. Tomorrow is our cookie bake. It turns out I am making the base for the Italian wedding soup for lunch. I also have to see if I can still make cookies.</p>
<p>I understand there is a big snowstorm on the east coast. We have had snow, too and it is very, very cold.</p>
<p>Wednesday we went to the library. It was the first clear day in a while. I wanted to get a book before it got sent back to its originating library and I had several to return. I also thought it would get us out.</p>
<p>Well, they're digging up alongside Wingra Creek. The intersection of Park and Wingra is not well shoveled and the sidewalk was deteriorating as we approached. I decided to go back. Elwood, who does not like backtracking, suggested we cross Wingra at South. There's a crosswalk and the down curb was shoveled. Normally I don't do this because there is not a stop sign on Wingra nor a light, but traffic was light enough and slow enough I thought we could manage it. Then I discovered the snowbank along the bike path. Okay, we'll walk along it to Fish and get onto the sidewalk there. I also found half a dozen cars parked along the road. Go around. Eventually we found where someone had shoveled through the snow to the bike path./ Much joy.</p>
<p>Our next surprise, or at least mine, was finding myself crossing a street and continuing on open sidewalk. Well, I thought it was open sidewalk. It turned out to be one of the lanes on the main street. In Elwood's defense, the opposite curb was plowed in and only a cut less than the width of a dog gave access to the sidewalk.</p>
<p>But here we were, in the street and we needed to get off of it. So we climbed the snowbank, me on hands and knees because it was too high to step over and too dense to slog through. This happened twice more on our return trip. Boy was I sore. I don't use those muscles. I did have that wonderful feeling of snow on my pant legs I remember from childhood. I haven't felt that for a long time and was quite surprised to find it locked away in memory.</p>
<p>Some of you are not receiving my emails. I'm sending them. Please check junk folders and add me to your white list or receive email from this person list.</p>
<p>I am using the new little netbook I got recently with St. Luke's purse gift. It is easy to carry with me and J. resolved some of my issues with it last night. It has a web cam so hopefully skype calls using it will have video. My home system defaults to my telephone which does not have video but I will see how the wireless connection behaves when I return and we'll go from there.</p>

My home system defaults to my telephone which does not have video but I will see how the wireless connection behaves when I return and we'll go from there.</p>

<p>I was working on my lap top and it was literally in my lap. Along came Elwood. He started to climb onto my lap, bone and all.</p>
<p>"Hey," I said, "there's no room. I can't have a dog and a computer on my lap."</p>
<p>He kept coming, proving that indeed I could have both a dog and a computer on my lap. I explained that the object was not to push the laptop off my lap. I think Elwood disagreed.</p>
<p>I have been busy with family here which was fun and nanowrimo which is hard but also fun. I'm within three days of finishing by Sunday.</p>
<p>Today we went off to the library. They've just instituted this great feature: you get an email 2 days before a book is due back. I had one to return.</p>
<p>Then we went to the grocery store. You would think this would be simple. It is not. I brought a list so that someone would have to read the list and therefore my helper would be able to read. He could read, but he doesn't shop. No householder would go through the store the way he did. To the baking isle. Grab an item. Go to the dairy isle. Grab an item. Go back to the baking isle. Grab another item. Go to ... well, you get the idea. I did not get a receipt as I never do anything with them but throw them out. Do you know I got a tub of margarine when I wanted a tub of whipped butter? I was so looking forward to it, too. Fortunately, I tasted before I put it on anything.</p>
<p>Sunday I went to the church's holiday fair which is a fund-raiser for people elsewhere who need things. You buy the things such as rabbits or water Buffalo's or birthing kits or meters of well drilling. That's the fair. I thought it would be a dull as dish water but it is actually exciting to decide how to spend money and why. Some of it is price. A blanket and a pair of rabbits costs the same. A whole water buffalo is $200 but was being sold in halves of buffaloes. We were uncertain is that meant left and right or front and back. There were soccer balls for Darfore, 50 chick lots and a solar powered water still. Someone was selling fair trade coffee and tea, too. The Sunday learns and staffs tables.</p>

<p>There is a hotel on Washington Island, Wisconsin. You can only get onto the island by ferry. Why am I telling you thiss? Because I went with melanie and J. to the Washington Island Coffee Shop which is a few blocks from my house. I didn't know it was there until recently. The office manager clued me into this and we will be going over the route on Monday. However, today Melanie and J. came to Madison on their way to a "romantic" weekend in Dodgeville. I think this is where land's End is located. If not, the town has a similar name. The coffee shop adjoins a knitting store. The restaurant is large and airy and in good weather, you can sit outside overlooking a park. Today it was sleeting when we went there and we were all quite cold and wet. I didn't have gloves. Melanie didn't have a scarf. We had lunch--pheasant quiche, broccoli and cheese soup, an autumn salad with apples and pumpkin seeds, a pickle and such sandwich. Those were our choices along with some other things. And of course, coffee. Just wonderful and delicious and a great beginning to a get-away weekend. The food is from the Washington island Hotel and Culinary School--fresh baked bread and locally grown produce where available and Fair Trade coffee. Pricey, too, but well worth it.</p>
<p>On Wednesday morning Elwood and I and our teacher walked to lake Wingra.</p>
<p>In all these adventures, Elwood does not like journeys that require retracing his steps. At the Seeing eye, all routes do not require backtracking. Not practical from everyday life, but practical for the trainers.</p>
<p>I am trying the bread maker for the second time. It turns out I had set the bread machine up incorrectly. The office manager stopped by to read the display and straighten things out.</p>
