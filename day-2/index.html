  <h3>Tear Your Heart</h3>

<h4>Reading</h4>

<p>Joel 2: 1-2, 12-17.</p>

<h4>Tear Your Heart</h4>

<p>Joel is calling upon the authorities in the temple to declare a national fast. I suspect, here in the United States where I live, such a thing would never happen. Instead, the President would proclaim a National Day of Prayer.</p>

<p>Either way, Joel is asking everyone to focus their attention because apparently there has been some sort of national disaster. Scholars differ whether an army has attacked and Joel compares it to a swarm of locusts, or whether a swarm of locusts have attacked and Joel compares it to a marauding army. Either way there is a catastrophe.</p>

<p>In the Bible, fasting is seen as a way to indicate to God ones sorrow over ones wrongdoing. In this case the national fast is to say that the nation itself, the people individually and collectively, have displeased God and therefore are trying to put things right between themselves and God.</p>

<p>Like any external activity that we do, we can do it in a way that just touches us on the outside. Fasting and tearing our garments is a sign of distress and grief. Joel however calls upon the people to not only refrain from eating and drinking but to weep, mourn and return to God, to tear their hearts rather than their clothes. In this sense, and we will see this in the next two days in other readings that we have about fasting, fasting is more than refraining from food. Fasting requires a change of heart, hence the tearing of ones heart.</p>

<p>The intent is not deprivation. Surely, with this famine upon the land, there is already deprivation. So it&rsquo;s not physical deprivation that will change anything; it is rather a means to get at the heart of each person.</p>

<p>If the prophet’s plea is for us to get at our own hearts right now:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is it that we need to fast from? * What do we need to tear our hearts about? * How do we go about returning to God and returning to God&rsquo;s ways?<br></li>
</ul>

<h4>Let us pray…</h4>

<p>Oh God, during this Lenten season may you continually invite us to return to you and to learn more deeply how to walk by your Spirit. Amen.</p>
