<p>Today we went to the medical center to "establish care". The Dean Medical Center is different from what I'm used to. It began when I called a phone number and got to what felt like a call center for making an appointment. I did speak to a nice person who wasn't rushed. But I had no information on the "office" number or where to find it except that it is in the building across the street. I did know where the front door was. The kids showed me the last time they were here. </p>
<p>So we went out, an hour ahead of our appointment and Elwood marched right up to the door and we did find the desk. A very helpful woman found someone to take me where I was going. I was at a long counter and a very helpful woman signed me in, found me a chair and then returned with more paperwork. Before that was completed, the office nurse turned up to bring me in. This was still more than half an hour before my appointment. I've lost another 5-6 pounds. Hurray! She took my blood pressure and it is better than its been and without medication as I had run out. I did want to test that. Immediately, the doctor turned up and did his thing. He spent more time looking at the computer screen than me, but all is managed by the machine. My pharmacy is listed, etc. There's a pharmacy in the building. </p>
<p>Then lab work was ordered and the nurse wisked me off to the lab which is on the same floor. It was 10 minutes before my appointment. Had I eaten? I was quickly wisked inside and afterwards taken to an outside door. </p>
<p>However, it was not the same door by which I had entered. It was a lovely day. We took a lovely walk. I can't tell you particularly where, but eventually we brushed against some overhanging branches. Ahah! Those are on Fish hatchery Road. We turned around and made our way home, but Elwood decided we should speed past the apartments. We turned around, made an incorrect (via my navigating) into the parking lot that leads to the grocery store, and Elwood and I disagreed about (a) turning around and (b) turning toward home, but in the end he marched right up to the door. Mission accomplished.</p>
<p>At our door was a bone he had brought outside. The apartment staff keeps an eye out. </p>
<p>In my email was the newsletter distributed to apartment residents reminding them about noise, smoke detectors and cleaning swtoves.</p>
<p>I requested and received this week's Sunday bulletin so I will be on track there, too.</p>
<p>Groceries arrived, a different person, who packs groceries differently. Take a bag and put vegetables and fruit in it. Don't separate them. Not really a problem, just a surprise. </p>
<p>I must have screwed up some quantities as I got fewer apples, but apple season lasts a long time. I was able to sort out the cans and label them as well as the bulk items. My new adventures are one of their salsas and a vegie chili mix made with textured soy. I wanted to try this because the direction online say I can make it as is, add tomatoes and/or beans. I thought it had some variation potential. </p>
<p>What continues to fascinate me is what is and is not available. Today green peppers were not available. Fortunately, when I submitted my order I knew this so I ordered purple peppers instead. They're tougher but were just fine with dinner. </p>
<p>I've just about worn out my crocs so S and I are emailing as to colors and wwinter styles. I'll go with a winter style and replace my originals. There's nothing like crocs.    </p>

<p>When I signed the lease, there was much emphasis on proper care of walls--no nails or tape. Picture hanging was offered. I decided, with the kids' help, that the large pictures should hang in the dining room. I figured the clocks could hang theere, too, out of the way but available to be wound. Unfortunately, many suitable walls have circuit breakers, thermostats, door phone, light switches, phone jacks and the like where something could be hung. The builders had first dibs. The maintenance man and a different helper arrived today, measured, had opinions and got the job done. The maintenance man has made three grandfather clocks. We talked about the Amana Colony and their clocks and furniture-making. One of the chains had jumped off its gear and he fiddled for some time to get it back on. Now everything is ticking along well. He even tightened the hands on the chiming clock, though he'll have to come back to adjust the hour hand. The clock is sounding one hour and reading another. Now I feel I am not living in a sterile environment.</p>

<p>Seeing Eye Dog</p>
<p>      We are delighted to have Rev. Merrill Woolnough, who recently moved to Madison from Jamestown New York, worshiping with us.  Her Seeing Eye Dog named Elwood accompanies her.  Parents and others have asked about how they should relate to the dog. Merrill has asked us to share the following in answer to this question:</p>
<p>
Elwood is a yellow Labrador Retriever.  He is three years old. We met at the Seeing Eye in Morristown, NJ in December, 2006 where we trained together for almost 3 weeks.</p>
<p>Seeing Eye dogs are chosen for their intelligence and ability to guide a blind person safely. They are not guard dogs. Protectiveness is not a desired trait because it would limit the blind person's ability to interact socially and professionally. As a result, Elwood is always glad to see people. However, interacting with him is dangerous, not for you, but for me. If he is distracted by a new friend, he may 
not be focused on his job, letting me know about obstacles such as  stairs and walls. This is particularly important in an unfamiliar environment like the church building.</p>
<p>Please do not touch Elwood or speak to him, especially by name. Using his name is how I get his attention to follow a command.  Thank you.   </p>

<p>The weather here has been hotter and cooler, humid and not. Overnight temps are going down. </p>
<p>Elwood and I took a walk Friday, around 3. Elwood grumbled in a dog way when I turned around at South Park, but we walked to South and Fish Hatchery, down and back on Midland and then came down Appleton. I expected to cross there--it Ts into South. To get a crosswalk, we need to walk down to West Wingra and then walk back almost to Appleton. Well, Elwood has figured out where he is. So he J walked across South. I knew because now South was on my right and not on my left. He marched down the sidewalk and turned into our driveway and up to the door. It was dinner time and Elwood does not like his dinner to be late. He is a lot like Nero Wolf in this way.</p>
<p>I ended up without a bulletin Sunday, but I knew most of the hymns more or less. I never know all the words. There were favorites among the familiar ones.</p>
<p>The sermons still don't reach me, but the worship does. My driver has lots of responsibilities so we were almost the last to leave. it's not a bad way to spend a Sunday morning though I miss Saturday night intimacy and Al's harmonica. </p>
<p>I'll post the article in the church newsletter about  Elwood and how not to interfere. First Sunday out it worked well.</p>
<p>Still getting life reordered for the good of the house.</p>

<p>I've had a lot of pain in my left shoulder. It has made doing a lot of tasks painful including working with Elwood since I hold the harness in my left hand. I thought it was a lot of things, some quirky and some dire, but I think I've solved the mystery. Because we cannot get the router working, I've been sitting at the computer desk and the keyboard of the laptop is at the wrong height. My shoulder doesn't get better because I use the keyboard every day. Having discovered this, I'm trying a work around: I plugged the keyboard from the desktop into the laptop and I'm sitting on a chair nearby with the keyboard in my lap. It's a little large for this purpose, but it's lighter than the whole laptop and I can deal with the USB cable. i was pleased that the laptop recognized the keyboard and transferred control to it. When I'm not using the keyboard I can set it on the keyboard shelf I bought for the desk and get it out when I need it. I also grabbed one of the dining room chairs to sit on which are comfortable. The only inconvenience so far is that I haven't bothered to plug in external speakers and so I'm using the laptop speakers. When a truck goes by I can't hear what the computer is saying, but then I could be sitting in front of it and have the same problem.</p>

<p>I'm still having quite a time  figuring out how much to buy through the coop. part of this is figuring out what I will need for the next ten days since I am trying to spread out my orders. I hope not to stockpile food this way, a bad habit I fall into. Food is not a problem. I will not starve. The other challenge is going by weight. Fairtrade jasmin tea, for example, is over $33 a pound. How much loose tea is that? How many ounces should I order? Well, I ordered some, I forget how much, and got quite a bit, more than I expected and make a cup of it with an infuser I bought back in 1981. It is quite good and fairly strong.</p>
<p>The delivery woman is also the person who organizes the order. She made some great calls. No yellow beans? She replaced them with green beans. One particular kind of kale was not available. She substituted another. The bagged oranges were better than the loose ones so she brought a bag. I said she did a great job. I also found I had some good containers which I picked up at the thrift store to put some bulk items in. </p>
<p>As usual, some items were a complete surprise. I ordered 8 ounces of bulk olive oil. It came in a flat container like you get at the delly. It will be interesting to see if I can funnel it into the bottle I bought. Maybe purchasing a bottle will be preferable. </p>
<p>I'll need to bathe Elwood myself. I bought doggie soap since I have nothing here. it's literally a bar of soap. </p>
<p>Murphy soap now comes concentrated. But then, the laundry detergent comes that way, too. </p>
<p>The mustard is in a plastic container which is unusual since I've either bought it in a tube or a glass jar. Gail did think I could make my own vinegrette and I thought I'd give it a try. </p>
<p>My shopping exploits get reported here because they are always an adventure. This time I learned that raw vinegar means it is fermented rather than chemically induced and not pasteurized. I didn't know vinegar was pasteurized. I only thought milk was pasteurized. Well, now I know.</p>
<p>Eggs come differently, too, white or brown,  or 12, omega 3, organic, from medium to jumbo. Fortunately I remembered I had bought Phil's from northern Illinois. </p>
<p>Half and half can also be purchased without being ultra pasteurized. It's cheaper though it will spoil faster.</p>
<p>The senior pastor from First Baptist came by last week. The church office emailed me the bulletin so I had a sense of what is going on during the service though many parts are taken from the hymnal. I gather it is put out by the Disciples of Christ. I also learned there are only 45 American Baptist churches in Wisconsin, most of them in Milwaukee. The yearly meeting for Wisconsin Baptists is held at Green Lake so I may get there in October. Green Lake was originally a get-away for the Chicago mob. </p>
<p>My carpool picked me up Sunday. Apparently, work is being done on my behalf to work out schedules since not everybody is around every Sunday. I met the man who got my email orginally. I also sent a notice to the church secretary about Elwood since lots of adults want to pet him. He got his tail stepped on and squeaked quite loudly. He also climbed up on the pew afterwards to talk to the person behind me whle I was speaking to someone in front of me. </p>
<p>The church always seems to be having technical difficulties with its speaker system at the beginning of church but it gets sorted out each time.</p>
<p>I even went for lawn lemonade after church.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to a new book discussion starting in September before church. The first book is Night by Elie Wiesel. I can download it from overdrive.</p>

<p>I've come to the conclusion that moving isn't just about moving, as frustrating as that is. It isn't even about stuff though that is continuing to be a frustration. It's about getting life running smoothly again. Moving is one of the great stressers because everything gets disrupted.</p>
<p>The kids came Saturday, all of them. It was really great to have them here. We just never have enough time to do anything but high level stuff. Anyway, we had fun at the coffee shop and checked out the neighborhood a little more. I may be able to access the light at the T intersection because it is across from an alleyway and Elwood recognized it. We also showed him how to cross a wider street. I learned that South Park and Fish hatchery cross each other. I wouldn't have expected this as I think of them as paralleling each other, but in madison there are no straight lines. We also found more torn up places so South park is out for now.</p>
<p>Patience, Melanie and I went to St. Vincent de Salles to look for some things I needed. I decided to pick up a writing desk so I'd have some drawers and a place to set the Braille machine and optacon. It's banged up a bit, but has the drawers on the left side which I need and was only $16. If I decide to give it back, it is no big loss. So far it is working out well. </p>
<p>I also found a number of containers to put Coop supplies in. I am able, for example, to buy vegetable-flavored broth powder in bulk. I buy a couple of ounces.

<p>Patience also found 3 salad plates which match my dishes. We couldn't believe it. They were 35 cents each. When I went to put them into the cubboard, I discovered they are a little smaller than my set so they're great for just needing one plate.</p>

<p>I've come to the conclusion that moving isn't just about moving, as frustrating as that is. It isn't even about stuff though that is continuing to be a frustration. It's about getting life running smoothly again. Moving is one of the great stressers because everything gets disrupted.</p>
<p>The kids came Saturday, all of them. It was really great to have them here. We just never have enough time to do anything but high level stuff. Anyway, we had fun at the coffee shop and checked out the neighborhood a little more. I may be able to access the light at the T intersection because it is across from an alleyway and Elwood recognized it. We also showed him how to cross a wider street. I learned that South Park and Fish hatchery cross each other. I wouldn't have expected this as I think of them as paralleling each other, but in madison there are no straight lines. We also found more torn up places so South park is out for now.</p>
<p>Patience, Melanie and I went to St. Vincent de Salles to look for some things I needed. I decided to pick up a writing desk so I'd have some drawers and a place to set the Braille machine and optacon. It's banged up a bit, but has the drawers on the left side which I need and was only $16. If I decide to give it back, it is no big loss. So far it is working out well. </p>
<p>I also found a number of containers to put Coop supplies in. I am able, for example, to buy vegetable-flavored broth powder in bulk. I buy a couple of ounces. It's crazy when I read it's $10 a pound. I'm using it in 1 teaspoon incraments. I made Happiness Soup and need more broth to reheat it.</p>
<p>Patience also found 3 salad plates which match my dishes. We couldn't believe it. They were 35 cents each. When I went to put them into the cubboard, I discovered they are a little smaller than my set so they're great for just needing one plate.</p>

<p>It's much cooler today and windy. Elwood and I took a walk. I had a plan. Elwood had a plan. They were not the same plan. We walked up South Street and negotiated crossing High Street and got to the corner. Walking along South Park we came to sidewalk construction. They are redoing the water main. A friendly man walked us around and we made our usual turn at Wingra. (The water across Wingra is Wingra Creek. I had just planned to walk back to the apartment but Elwood suggested we go farther. Well, okay, it's a nice day. We crossed South and walked both sides of Appleton. Oh dear, going back home. A wacky crossing. Somehow, we ended back on Appleton though I thought it was South so suddenly came to a different sort of intersection. Hmm. Where are we Elwood? I started retracing my steps and decided we must be along Fish hatchery Road. I was certain when we crossed Wingra. Elwood was positive he didn't want to go on the bike path so we walked down Planert. He would have been off to the railroad tracks and beond I'm sure if I hadn't insisted we turn. The "store" on the corner with the announcements turns out to be a car dealership. When we got back to Wingra, Elwood was all for going on the bike path, but enough is enough. We crossed, orange cones and dirt and stone at the corner and all and retraced our steps. Now we are going back. Well, if I insisted, and Elwood even picked the correct driveway. He really does know where he lives.</p>
<p>I stopped off in the office and while in conversation, discovered the medical center is across the street from the parking lot I traverse to go to the grocery store. This is where the doctors' offices are and some out patient services. They have a Fish Hatchery address, but I can access it from the South Street side. Talk about convenient. Bit by bit the neighborhood is coming into focus.</p>
<p>The Council Of the Blind is trying to get me some mobility services. Orientation and Mobility people are rare--a definite career possibility for someone who likes to be outside. We will also see about para transit. It's a bit dicy but apparently can be arranged. This will take some time to do. </p>
<p>In conversation, i also have learned that the reason my water is so soft is because Madison water is very, very hard and it is softened.</p>
<p>My other little victory is learning how to plug my cordless vacuum in to be recharged. I thought it was in the handle. It's on the base so now I always have power.</p>

<p>We've been busy this weekend. Saturday morning we took a walk and traveled some new streets. We went to the grocery store. Elwood identified a helpful person and I had a nice chat with the customer service man who, when I asked for a roll of quarters, said, "laundry day, huh?" elwood wanted to tour afterwards, but I kept insisting he find the stairs to the medical center parking lot and he finally did that. </p>
<p>I came home and made gazpacho as well as a fragrant Indian dish for supper. Fortunately it was good because i have a lot of it. </p>
<p>Today I went to First Baptist. My email was forwarded to the Board of chair. He contacted me. Another person contacted me because the chair was going out of town. Finally, a third person contacted me who will probably be my fairly steady ride. She is out of town next sunday but made arrangements for me. I was introduced to everyone as a retired pastor. I didn't know this about me, but for now it is a good enough cover story. </p>
<p>All church services are different even when following the same basic plan. For example, in this congregation on this day, the offertory came very early in the service. They have a wacky rewrite of the Lord's Prayer. We had a second-career seminarian as preacher. The Minister of Discipleship presided at Communion and did an outstanding job with her prayers. We filed to the front to receive. Intinction isn't my favorite but with grape juice it's the best anyone can do. It was the "bread of life" and the "cup of compassion", compassion being the theme of the day. I haven't checked, but I'm guessing we were on target for the lectionary. </p>
<p>The children's sermon was interesting. The children went forward. The minister read a retelling of the Gospel. People held up signs for thefour keywords: Jesus, people, bread, fish. Every time one of these words was read, the sign went up and the congregation repeated the word. It certainly makes you pay attention to every word. Try it.</p>
<p>Afterwards a group met about supporting those on probation and getting their lives back together again. I went to this meeting because the driver went to this meeting. I got home about 3 hours after I had left.</p>
<p>This church has greeting down pat. Everyone introduces themselves. They bring other peopole over to introduce them to you. It will be interesting to see what happens next. It will also be interesting to meet the senior pastor who is currently on vacation.</p>
<p>Elwood was very good and did not climb in my lap or walk on the pews.  </p>
