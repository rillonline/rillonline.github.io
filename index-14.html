<p>As I write this, it is 48 degrees and windy. Fortunately, the heat is on and the talking thermostat is installed and working well. it was quite a shock to listen to the Brewers game today with the game time temperature in Philadelphia at 72. I think it was 49 here. </p>
<p>Went off to church for dinner, discussion and Bible study. Still getting to know people. They are patient with me and work hard to identify themselves which is very nice. Elwood was very restless. He doesn't like a cold floor on which to lay down and Bible study ran long. He wanted to go home. </p>
<p>We will have a time for Taize worship Sunday morning. I will try it out. It means not going to the book discussion, but it's only the first Sunday of the next 3 months. We will be reading The hHeart of Christianity by Marcus Borg. Fortunately, it is a Talking Book  download so it will be easy to access. </p>
<p>I learned today my local hardware store gives a 10% discount to locals. And they're finished working on the street. I don't know yet if they've repaired the areas they dug up.</p>

<p>I've been using the FM tuner in my Iriver mp3 player to listen to my NPR station. In Madison, I get Wisconsin Public Radio so there's little local news but some state news. It's not a really powerful radio. I had my boombox sitting on the work station which wasn't good for reception. I brought it into the dining room but it wouldn't work. The batteries were dead. I finally checked it out in the bedroom and the radio worked if plugged in. I brought it back to the dining room. No soap. On a hunch, I threw the switch in the living room. Voila. This particular socket is controlled by the switch. Now the radio is working fine and the Brewers' game is on. It's a Milwaukee station. Two stations away the same game is playing out of Chicago. Not looking good for the Brewers in the 3rd inning.</p>

<p>Today I went shopping with 2 new friends from church. We hit Good Will first. I found jeans, shirts of various kinds, tan pants, a wool pair of pants, a merino sweater to match and a comfy red valore shirt. My discount card from Good Will is not valid in Madison. Elwood hung out with our driver. Elwood does not like hanging out but he doesn't like changing rooms either. Then we went to lunch--an Albanian owned diner with American style food--very pleasant. Elwood was very good as he and I were reunited and basking in that was enough for him. We did Walmart afterward to find a few things unavailable at Good Will. A good time was had by all and will be repeated when they return from Upper Michigan peninsula.  </p>

<p>Sunday I went out to lunch with my ride and some family members. Not all the people in the "family" are directly related to one another which makes it remarkable that they consider themselves family. I had the opportunity to review a Braille menu which was not only incomplete in the meals offered but some of the words were cut off. The folks were startled that the Braille did not follow the large print. I was surprised they thought it would as they are different sizes. Afterwards, we stopped at the farmer's market at my corner. I was able to pick up some vegetables for the week. The carrots are all knobby and odd sizes which makes them fun. I decided to offer one to Elwood as a treat. I think he was quite shocked about it though he didn't refuse it and went off to enjoy it. After church I got some apples, too, which were from an orchard though how they arrived and what the distribution method was I did not learn. One of my lunch companions offered to go thrift store shopping with me later in the week. We will firm things up at the Wednesday night dinner. One of my Bible study companions came to chat after church. It was nice to recognize a few people.</p>

<p>Today I have spent a great deal of time in the kitchen and I have more time to spend there later. I've been cleaning up and cooking. Today I made a big batch of vegetable soup which will be handy for quick meals. I used sweet potatoes instead of the fingerlings and I've decided I like the fingerlings better, but the sweet potatoes will have to do for this batch. I also tried the beef bacon which is cut thick like Canadian bacon, I think. It may be already cooked because it didn't feel raw. It is not at all fatty so did not make a mess in the microwave when I heated it up. I had an egg and bacon sandwich.</p>
<p>I brought a CD back to the library because it had the wrong CD in the case. I discovered the doors are automatic to some degree at the library so will have to get the hang of this. I think we greeted someone from the farmer's market. Elwood still does not like leaving the library and going home. Well, get over it!</p>
<p>I decided to walk home taking South Park to Midland. This was handy as the train came while we were still within earshot. This allowed me to not only here the whistle, which I can hear from the apartment, but also the unmistakable dinging sound at the crossing. I have the sense the train moves slowly as I didn't hear the train itself. I haven't figured out the train schedule yet.</p>
<p>I went to the meal, discussion group and Bible study Wednesday night at church. They read an excerpt from Barbara Brown Taylor's book Leaving Church. As an accommodation, they read out loud which was a new experience in listening and tone for them. Of course, this meant we didn't get to a discussion because reading aloud is different from reading silently. I also asked people to identify themselves as they went around the circle for the before-reading sharing. It is interesting that people didn't just give their names, but described their relationships and gave me background to their comments. i was willing to just go with the flow and pick up on all this as it came though I asked for names. Elwood got up when it was my turn so he got to share, with my help, too. The plus of his week was going on a new route. The minus was my insistence that we turn around and retrace our steps.</p>
<p>I am learning how to use the Madison public library site. Since the regional library sent me a cassette machine, I will borrow cassettes from the library. I've found some of interest as well as compact disc books. I've put in several requests and emails should arrive when the books arrive at my branch. The system is a bit unwieldy as I have to find the author first and then limit results to either cassettes or CDs. There's no category that is simply audio. </p>
<p>I have read some different books lately. I did a lot of reading while I was in the kitchen. Gentlemen and Players is a complicated tale told from two perspectives. It has some surprising plot twists. I can't say more without spoiling it. This would be a good book discussion title. </p>
<p>I also read Gentlemen of the Road by Chabon. I read his The Policemen's Union which is an alternate history police procedural. Chabon wanted to call Gentlemen of the Road Jews with Swords. It is a great tale of one Franc and one Abyssinian, both Jews, who are traveling in the area around the Caspian Sea, encountering armies and other thieves--Vikings, Muslims and Jews. The elephants are great. I'm not sure this is a good discussion book but it's quite entertaining.</p>
<p>One of my fun things to do is read the recently returned section of the overdrive site for the Wisconsin Public library Consortium. I can pick up books I would never know about here. I've just started one written by the Dahli Lama about spirituality and science and another one on the history of the calendar.</p>

<p>Today Elwood and I went to our local library. On Sunday J. and Melanie scoped it out. On the way, we said "Hi," to the farmer's market folks. If I had wanted something, I should have gotten it then because on our way back it was crowded. We had a misadventure, mistaking a driveway as a street and ending up amid housing and such. Elwood does not like retracing his steps so backtracking is difficult, but South park is a busy street so I can hear our general direction. We found our way to Villager Mall where the library is. We did pass the library and when we entered a clothing store, they urriedly told us we weren't in the right place. "The library is next door," they said. I had a helpful librarian. I am registered not only for the library but to vote and I brought home two CD books. In looking at the library site, I discovered I am reading a previous book from the library's book discussion group. The month's book is about September 11 and I don't think I want to read that so I'll wait for next month. It is disappointing. I also discovered the library has an RSS feed of its events. Right now they are starting a workshop on writing down your memories. They have story time, a knitting group and classes and help with writing--resumes, job applications, etc. 
My beach crocs arrived today. Boy were my old ones worn!</p>

<p>Sunday was cold and rainy in the morning.. My ride was late. The rain drops got harder and more frequent. When my ride to church arrived, I said we needed an inclement weather policy. We have now agreed where I should wait in case I cannot be out at the curb.</p>
<p>Our conversation around Elie Wiesel's book is still very largely lecture, but I think that is more the desire of the leader to share info than a desire to squelch conversation. The holocaust and the history of the Jews is, after all, quite a large topic. Next week we are to share passages.</p>
<p>The jux apposition of this book with Sunday's sermon was quite jarring. The basic thrust was to develop a sense of wonder: God's rescue of the people at the Red Sea. We don't hear that anyone was lost. As I thought about it, I thought about the 400 years or so it took for God to send Moses. Many were lost. The people, in the end, were saved. Is this a connection? It raises all sorts of questions.</p>
<p>The Children's Moment is worth sharing. The children were the children of Israel. The congregation stood in the center isle. They were the Red Sea. The children were stopped. When the adults moved out of the center isle, the children were free to move forward. </p>
<p>I have learned that there is a dinner group that meets on Wednesdays followed by some kind of discussion--a small group experience. I will try it out and the Bible study which follows it. This group is reading the Book of Mark.Rides have been arranged.</p>
<p>J. and Melanie came. We had split pea soup. Willie Street only has green split peas. I added carrots and smoked turkey which gave it good flavor without adding salt. Someone from the church had visited during the week and brought chocolate chip cookies. The kids ate them up and brought the 4 remaining ones with them for the homeward journey.</p>
<p>We did paperwork which was necessary, but we also checked out where the local library is. It is less than a mile away. It seems a pretty straight forward run. This library is not open on Sundays so we couldn't go in. It is in a shopping center which has been taken over mostly with non-shopping stores like a medical center and human services. </p>
<p>The neighborhood changes as we walk south. We were amused that a Taco Bell is right next door to an "authentic" Mexican restaurant. The neighborhood is definitely Spanish-speaking. This is a different neighborhood than mine with a different name and there has been trouble in parts of it, but no sign of problems on our walk. People are just people.</p>
<p>On the way back we stopped at a farmer's market in the field on the corner. I had thought it was Saturdays and wish I knew about it sooner. Not many people around midday of a chilly day, but the vendors were very friendly. I bought apples and sweet potatoes from one man who handed out slices of apple, had a long tasting with a woman who sells grass-fed beef and bought kohlrabi's and blue beans which turn green when cooked from a Mong woman. I bought bacon from the beef woman. I think it is interesting that a Mong immigrant grows local food stuffs in the Madison area. I wonder if she was a farmer in Laos.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, we went out to dinner at a Mong restaurant the kids like. It is moderately priced, but not a "foreign" experience. It's a noisy regular restaurant with American weight staff. The hotness of the food comes in several layers. I chose careful and J. had native Lao. I think melanie likes cautious. There is also adventurous. </p>
<p>I had wide rice noodles with lots of veggies and shrimp. Very tasty. I can get rice noodles at the coop. I ordered green tea to drink. It was honey green tea. J. had a sweet coffee which turned out to be iced and with a touch of coriander in it. It would have been a great dessert.   </p>

<p>Yesterday our special music at church was an African Drum Choir. I gathered this is a special choir at the church. It was quite wonderful, very different from a marching band. It is clear to me how drums can be said to talk. Some people really didn't like them because of the volume. I was sitting up close and it wasn't too loud. Elwood got a little nervous, but he got through it all right. We had a good sermon, too. God is not a good idea. God is alive and relational. Again, a different version of the Lord's Prayer and "sitting" Communion this time. I discovered I had to break off a piece of bread. That changes, too, from broken off for you or breaking it yourself. My guess is that people have opinions on this, too, and so some of the people are happy at any given time.</p>
<p>I also went to a class which is reading Elie Wiesel's Night. The conversation should be interesting. We mostly got background info, including how IBM punched cards and leased equipment kept track of everyone in Nazi camps.</p>
<p>They are still digging up my streets. </p>
<p>We've had rain. Last week's rain was from Gustav. I don't know about today's rain. It's much colder today, too. I went down to the storage unit to fish out some long-sleeved clothing and sweaters/jackets. Some clothes looked familiar while some did not. I have no idea what fits. I'll just put them on as I go and see.</p>
<p>I can now download titles from Recording for the Blind. I remember when we used flexible discs on a record player. Then we moved onto reel to reel tape. The whole library is not available yet. Titles may not be available instintly but get converted and uploaded in a few days. The licensing process is awkward as I have to use Windows Media Player, but I did sync a title to my phone and listened from there. I'm trying to see if my Zen Stone will work also. </p>
<p>Grocery delivery tomorrow. The fresh food changes. I'm moving onto apples from nectarines. I am also trying a northern Chinese vegetable I have never heard of before. There is always opportunity for expanding horizons.  </p>
