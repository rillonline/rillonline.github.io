Nick, my Seeing Eye dog, and I took a walk this morning.
</p>

<p>
Now I know that taking a walk with your dog is not a novel experience for any dog owner. What was significant about this walk was that it took place immediately after my breakfast and before my exercise class at the senior center.
</p>

<p>
Normally I would have listened to my podcast app while sucking down at least one large cup of coffee. Instead, I skipped my morning coffee and got walking.
</p>

<p>
Our walk lasted about 40 minutes. We walked a route we just learned from our friend Sandy, but we walked it backwards. Nick trotted right along and got very excited when I chose to walk on the other side of Terrace Avenue. Nick had not walked down this side of the street yet.
</p>

<p>
I'm not sure how long the route is, maybe over 2 miles.
</p>

<p>
We have not been able to walk for several days because of our schedule and the rain. As it was not raining and it was fairly cool, it was a wonderful time to walk.
