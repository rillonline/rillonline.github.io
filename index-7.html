<p>Elwood wants to take a walk but today hasn't been a good day for a walk. The temp is fine. I've just had things to do.</p>
<p>We went to the Farmer's MArket. Elwood sniffed, went under the tables to see what is stored there and ate a flower.</p>
<p>Elwood came home, and after having his flea stuff was aplied, went and curled up on the day bed. He's near the same color as the day bed but he has brown eyes and the comforter on thebed does not so someone saw him there. </p>
<p>And through it all he kept climbing up to tell me he is having a hard day. What kind of day does he think I am having?</p>

<p>We went to the river walk this afternoon. I prepared for not having the picnic table. This was also our exercise today as it is again very humid.  I found a tree and tied Elwood to it. I laid a towel on the grass. Elwood raced to claim it.</p>
<p>I should mention that Elwood likes to sleep on towels and laundry in the other room. I call it Elwood has his own bedroom. </p>
<p>I tried to get everything in order. Elwood wrapped himself in the wires of my ear buds. He rolled. He licked. He wriggled. He managed to unhook the ear buds from the iPod and lay so completely on everything I had difficulty getting reconnecting. I laid on my back. Elwood curled up with his head on my arm and was quite content.</p>
<p>We went through the whole thing when I went to pack up about an hour later. Something was biting my ankle and I couldn't write.</p>
<p>We started down the path, but Elwood vered off to the grass and when I was losing patience with his vering, he stopped in front of the picnic table bench. We stayed for anoher hour and a half. I finally put the towel downk kept one foot on it so it wouldn't blow away and Elwood settled down though he was still tied to the bench as he had been tied to the tree. </p>
<p>I want to be sure I knew where he was and what he was getting into.</p>
<p>It continues to amaze  me how much cooler the river walk is than the street</p>

<p>Today we reworked we had trouble with yesterday. We walked across the bridge, very noisy with trucks today. Beforehand, Elwood wanted to walk down Fairmount to 3rd Street. When we were starting across Steel, a car cut us off. The instructor yelled at the driver who was talking on the phone. I retreated to the curb. We worked through Fairview. Both curbs are hard to find because they are very curvey. Elwood wants very much to go down the side streets. It's not as noisy and new areas are far more fun to explore than doing the same old thing over and over.</p>
<p>It is much cooler here at the river walk. I wish I had figured this out when it was so hot. It's quite breezy here and the air is so heavy with humidity just a block away.</p>
<p>Elwood would prefer we went home for dinner but it is so pleasant here and I want him to grow comfortable here. We successfully found the picnic table and I think he will get the idea quite quickly. We have the area to ourselves there there is the traffic from the parking lots and the smell from the Chinese buffet.</p>

<p>Elwood's ideas about reading and blogging at riverside are very different from my ideas. He got tangled and I wanted to be sure he was present and not off somewhere else so I added the flxi lead to the mix. Elwood was thrilled. He came right over, got between my legs, curled up and settled in It made moving or using the bluetooth keyboard impossible because every time he settled his chin on one leg and I moved the keyboard to the other leg, he had to move and use the keyboard leg. There was to be no competition for my body parts.</p>
<p>So I read something else. Then we got up and sort of left, but I realized no one was at the picnic table so we went in search of it and eventually found it. I tried several tying options. Togetherness is Elwood's priority. Fortunately, laying down on the bench was not one of his ideas--at least this time. I was able to work some. I will have to bring some towels so if I need to sit on the grass, it will be more comfortable. Maybe I will even get to stretch out though Elwood might think this was an invitation to cuddle up.</p>

<p>I thought we would spend some time on the River Walk.Unfortunately, other people were at the picnic bench, a 3-generational family. Elwood thought we should join them.  They did not invite us so I found this tree. Elwood is doing what dogs do with trees--get tangled around them. Nest time, I will bring a towel. My windbreaker is a little small to sit upon.</p>
<p>Earlier we did our 5k. We got lost. We ended up several blocks away from our target but people are helpful and we got ourselves reoriented. Fairmount residential and 3rd? We wanted 5th. Go this way. I hope Elwood appreciates the walk and that we need to be a little more attentive to our route rather than exploring the neighborhood.</p>
<p>I had wanted to sit by the babbling part of the river. Instead I have air conditioners but it's the principle of the thing. We have a breeze and temperatures in the 70s which is far preferable to me. I still had to strip after our big walk.</p>

<p>We did it! We set out from the apartment, walked to Prendergast, went to 5th and went all the way to Fairview where we went down to Harding. I decided to walk Harding instead of going back to Fairmount. I didn't feel like walking back up the hill and Fairmount is busy and noisy. There was a fair amount of traffic on harding, but it's basically residential. </p>
<p>We had a little trouble at Steel. We will need to review the intersection, as to where it is. We also overshot on Harding and coming back, Elwood did one of those wonderful diagonal crossings to get to where he needed to be. The good people at the intersection just waited for us to get out of the street. I found the button at 3rd and we sailed home.</p>
<p>There were still people gathered around at the dregs of the Farmer's Market. I didn't know how late there was activity there. Some guy complained loudly about almost being run over by a Seeing Eye dog. Good heavens! The dog is only trying to make his living and you can see. You have a big mouth, too, so you could have said something earlier to help instead of just bitch and moan. I was trying to make sure Elwood wasn't shopping or visiting so I kept him moving.</p>
<p>Earlier today we went to the market. Elwood still wants to shop. The man with the chawawa wanted to take our picture for his scrapbook. I questioned him carefully about this. Sad. I was concerned about his motives and he just collects dog pictures.</p>
<p>our walk this afternoon took about an hour and twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Today a new hire came to learn about technology. Of course, Elwood thought this was a new friendship in the making. We sent this picture back to the Blind Association and titled it Debbie hard At Work.<a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/merrillnelwood/pic/00002w37"><img title="" height="480" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/merrillnelwood/pic/00002w37" align="center"></a></p>

<p>Today Elwood went to the spa. Elwood doesnot like the spa. The groomers touch his feet. They get him wet. They look into his ears. They use a blow dryer on him. But he is clean, nice smelling and they even gave him a potty break. It was hot in Lakewood my skin was burning in the sun around my collar bone.</p>
<p>Elwood cried when he heard my voice at the desk. I guess he thought he had been abandoned. He was excited to get his harness on and get out of there. He'll be back in two months. You have to schedule the next appointment when you are there because they are filling up quickly.</p>
<p>The new facility is quite large. I hope they get help.</p>

<p>I don't know if this posted on Monday but if not, here it is as I wrote it: .'m told it's lucky to be on a bridge when a train passes under. We were cross the 6th Street bridge when I heard the train.</p>
<p>Of course, if you know the train schedule, you could always be on the bridge when it went under. I suppose is luck is a real thing, you'd have to be on the bridge as an act of randomness rather than as a plan--as if there is a rule about luck, its acquisition  and loss.</p>
