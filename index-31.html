<p>I am working through my posts on <a class="reference external" href="http://raspberryvi.org/">raspberryvi.org</a> to prepare them for a re-launch of the
site. It's a fun activity.</p>
<p>I am looking out for formatting errors, letting the posts stand as
they are. However, I found some information that appears not to be
correct anymore. I tried to run it down, but couldn't, so I learned
how to write a footnote in restructured text instead.</p>
<p>The error was in a post about orgmode. I stopped using org for one
reason or another. Perhaps my blog will tell me. Reading these old
posts made me remember how satisfying orgmode is to use. Perhaps I
will use it for notes or something. That would make me happy and keep
my hand in.</p>
<p>Sadly, I don't think there's a converter that works well with rst and
org. Pandoc may not be up to the challenge. I know Nikola has an org plugin.</p>
<p>Update: 2019/08/19</p>
<p>My posts are no longer on the site and are fairly out-of-date
now. I left org because I was overwhelmed by all of the documentation
and did not know how to limit preamble and postamble stuff. I needed
to post in html so needed to use export and then manually copy the
html into a text box.</p>

<p>I started the day thinking I would experiment with Mate on Debian. I started a fresh install on my old laptop. By noon I was digging out a netbook and expecting to put apache and webmin on it. I did but ran into a few problems with ssl again. I thought I would be going back to owncloud. I found some commands for ssl on the manual installation page.</p>
<p>Then I began to wonder while I was setting up the second netbook: why won't this work on a pi and why not use ftp.</p>
<p>This was brought about because I confused file server with ftp server on the Debian install. It turns out that file server means samba.</p>
<p>So here's the plan:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Configure vsftp to use external storage.</li>
<li>Connect the ntfs 2TB external drive as well to the pi and use it as a backup to the ext4 drive.</li>
<li>Use a cron job to keep everything in sync and email the results.</li>
</ol>
<p>By doing this I can corral my files for publishing and writing to La Jefa.</p>

<p>I'm proud to be Celtic today, but then I'm proud to be Celtic every day.</p>
<p>It was incredibly warm today. I wore a sweatshirt outside and was too hot.</p>
<p>We took a very long walk with panting and everything. We went to Regent Street via the Arbor item. Dogs and their people were everywhere and all the dogs misbehaved. I guess they are thinking it has been a long winter, too. </p>
<p>I thought I would see if I could find the dock, but I didn't and went on to Regent Street to see how the walk down South Randall turned out. L had driven it and said there was sidewalk all the way and there is. Along Vilas--I don't know exactly how I ended up on Vilas--there is a very steep hill so not a plan for winter months to walk there. </p>
<p>I went into this cafe where I had been previously. We ended up at the kitchen and the guys there acted very weird. I decided they lacked social skills. perhaps they were closed, but there door was open. They gave me a bottle of soda on the house and I thought I'd sit, drink the diet Coke and listen to my iPod. Well, being in an empty cafe is a really weird experience and I had the iPod upside down in the arm strap. By the time I took off my sweatshirt, fixed the iPod and drank a little soda, it was too weird to stay so we left. I almost thought I was locked in the place. The doors wouldn't push open. Eventually,, I found a release very low on the door and we left. It was beginning to feel very much like a horror movie.</p>
<p>Of course I had to walk around with a full poop bag in my pocket. I wonder if the guys at the restaurant could smell it and wondered what might be wrong with me. Unfortunately, I can't find garbage cans. On one corner I found some bins but decided they could easily be mailboxes and I didn't want to mail the stuff.</p>
<p>People were everywhere. Traffic rolls pretty slowly around town except for the major thoroughfares. We were out for about 2 hours, walking most of the time. Elwood actually thought he'd like to get home, get a drink and get some dinner.</p>
<p>It's supposed to cool down tomorrow and maybe rain or snow or something.</p>
<p>It was windy today, too. It would have been March nasty if it was colder. </p>
