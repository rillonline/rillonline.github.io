  <html><body><p>There have been grumbles that I haven't updated this journal recently. I guess that is because I've been tired and frustrated with my internet service. I guess I'll have to get on that soon because it isn't working with my wireless router and that is a real pain. 
<p>There are still some boxes to be unpacked, some stuff to go down in the storage area and some odds and ends of packing materials to go in the dumpster. Elwood is very good about finding the dumpster and the recycling dumpster which is behind it.</p>
<p>And then there will be lugging wash to the basement with Elwood and getting more stuff downstairs and not getting lost in the basement. I forgot to make a turn and we were all over the place. Add to that the boxes I put down and then had to find again to put in my storage area.</p>
<p>One of the great things about Elwood is that he sits quietly while I put things in and out of the washer and dryer. Caitlin would have been long gone. Itâ€™s odd using a front loader again. I havenâ€™t done this since college and had to be reminded that the soap gets put in somewhere else than on the clothes.</p>
<p>Ordering from the coop works well. I still have to learn how much of what I want. However, Elwood can get us to and from the local grocery store so there is a backup plan. I just have to find customer service and see how that goes.</p>
<p>Everything else is coming along very slowly. I always have these ideas that Iâ€™ll have all my connections in place. It just isnâ€™t happening quickly. The unpacking and figuring out where things go. There is a lot of shelf space here but things are going in different places than in previous situations so everything takes a lot of thought. It also has been warm and I have been reluctant to use the air conditioner.</p>
<p>There are still some repairs to be made to the apartment, some missing hooks and several of the burners for the stove were not connected. One needs to be repaired. The maintenance person has been on grand baby arrival duty so this is taking a little longer.</p>
<p>I now know the garbage truck comes on Wednesday afternoons. They cut the grass and both are very noisy.</p>
<p>The corner on the way to the bike path is under construction. We will check on that again soon. Elwood and I could use a good walk. Evenings bring mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Sara called for a meet up while she was in Madison which was a surprise. We had a short but intense visit as I wanted to learn about her plans. We went to the local coffee shop to review this again with Elwood and it gave me a chance to cross the medical center parking lot when it had cars in it. He is great about thisâ€“very reliable and knows his way home.</p>
<p>I have put the apartment on toy patrol since he does occasionally bring a toy outside and if i hadnâ€™t said anything, they would have been tossed as the maintenance people do grounds patrol. Now that they are alerted his toys will be returned.</p>
<p>J. and melanie were here over the weekend and helped with things around the apartment. We had a lovely dinner of gazpacho and quisedias. We are hoping to have patience and Brian join us for an outing in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>I got unburied enough to be able to sit in a chair by the window and read without doing anything. It was great.</p></body></html></p>
