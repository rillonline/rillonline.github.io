  <html><body><p>Well, I'm over my cold. it was certainly nasty. Elwood was irritated that we didn't go anywhere.
<p>We‚Äôve had 2 mobility lessons and we‚Äôll be having our final lesson next week. Elwood is still resisting the library run but I have a much better feel for it. I‚Äôve been picking up cassette books, not my favorite way of reading anymore, but the library has a lot of books on cassette. i have my bom box and the player from the library for the blind. Unfortunately, the tapes have a lot of background noise on them, the book itself either slightly ahead of slightly behind which makes listening a challenge though doable. I just finished a biography ofDorothy L. Sayers which was supposed to be complimentary but I decided she wasn‚Äôt terribly likable though her friends found her generous and funny. It is so easy to request books, now that I know how to do the search, that I‚Äôm afraid I will always have stacks and stacks of books.
Today we did some fun. We learned where several cool eateries in our area are. I had breakfast at Curve. Curve is about six or seven blocks away, with a major street crossing and the only audible signal in my area. We traipsed off and found the place all right. When I walked in, I realized the joint was jumping. I had gone after what I judged to be prime breakfast time. But then again, today and tomorrow is teacher‚Äôs convention and school is closed. The women and children were at the tables. The men and I sat at the counter. I walked in and stood against the wall, not sure how to proceed. A man at the counter directed me to a seat. The counter man, and wait staff, cashier, et al asked if I wanted coffee. There was a great place for Elwood under the counter. I ordered eggs. ‚ÄúWheat toast?‚Äù the man asked. It must be Madison. And that‚Äôs what came, just 2 eggs and two pieces of toast. The hard part was getting him to slow down enough to pay. The man to my left ate and left and another man came who didn‚Äôt even realize he was sitting next to a dog. He flagged the counter man down and eventually, I paid and could leave. I‚Äôlll definitely go back. There‚Äôs a crew of regulars.
We also stopped at the hardware store to pick up some CFL light bulbs. The counter is at the door so you just say what you want and that‚Äôs that.
I worked with Melanie and with the office manager here at the apartment to learn the way to the polls. It‚Äôs across the audible signal street and down 3 blocks. I can‚Äôt get inside the building to scope it out but assume building will be open on Tuesday and that there‚Äôll be enough people around that I will get to where I‚Äôm going.
I had a great visit with J. and Melanie. We went to Lazy Jane‚Äôs which is downtown. It‚Äôs in a house. You walk in, give your order, lots of tofu stuff and then wait for your name to be bawled throughout the house. it must be madison‚Äìcream, 2% milk or soy milk for your coffee. We sat upstairs and Melanie fetched our food when called. You stack your tray and leave when done. We stopped by the coop and St. Vinnie‚Äôs. They were having their bicycle clearance sale. The bikes are in the basement and apparently at the end of October they close it for the winter. The bikes were 75% off.
it turns out my storm windows were put on backwards, but that has been fixed.
A warm day today. Don‚Äôt know how long this will last. It was freezing cold Monday with a few snow flurries.
I haven‚Äôt been to the Wednesday night group for 2 weeks. I was sick the first week and my driver was sick yesterday. To be continued.
Tomorrow Elwood and I need to go back to the library and hopefully I have the documentation to get him a bath. They needed his medical records, well, the rabies shot info. His tag says 20 04 which doesn‚Äôt mean he got the shot in 2004. He wasn‚Äôt born until 2005.
Nanowrimo starts Saturday.</p></body></html></p>
