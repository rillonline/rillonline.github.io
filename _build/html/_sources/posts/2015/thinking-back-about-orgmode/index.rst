I am working through my posts on `raspberryvi.org
<http://raspberryvi.org/>`_ to prepare them for a re-launch of the
site. It's a fun activity.

I am looking out for formatting errors, letting the posts stand as
they are. However, I found some information that appears not to be
correct anymore. I tried to run it down, but couldn't, so I learned
how to write a footnote in restructured text instead.

The error was in a post about orgmode. I stopped using org for one
reason or another. Perhaps my blog will tell me. Reading these old
posts made me remember how satisfying orgmode is to use. Perhaps I
will use it for notes or something. That would make me happy and keep
my hand in.

Sadly, I don't think there's a converter that works well with rst and
org. Pandoc may not be up to the challenge. I know Nikola has an org plugin.

Update: 2019/08/19

My posts are no longer on the site and are fairly out-of-date
now. I left org because I was overwhelmed by all of the documentation
and did not know how to limit preamble and postamble stuff. I needed
to post in html so needed to use export and then manually copy the
html into a text box.
