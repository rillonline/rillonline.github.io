I keep getting distracted from my writing by inventing bits and pieces
to fiddle with in Linux or on my phone. I must stop and get back to
writing. I have set aside this long weekend to do just that.

I have also signed up to resume going to the poetry class. I've
attended the meetings when they are in session and it is starting up
again on june 2.
