<html><body><p>This blog has material from two previous blogs on LiveJournal. I imported them here earlier this year. Admittedly, there is a major gap between 2009 and 2016. Perhaps there’s some stuff on Facebook, but, apparently, I wasn’t blogging and writing much about myself. You can take this two different ways:
</p><ol>
	<li>I just wasn’t interested or got around to doing it.</li>
	<li>I am a selfless person and writing about myself was distasteful to me.</li>
</ol>
As I am not a particularly selfless person, you can just call me lazy.

Now I am starting to blog again because I am getting a new guide dog and writing about this experience is a lot of fun.</body></html>
