A week or so ago Elwood and I walked down East 2nd Street to Washington Street. We were avoiding 3rd Street which has a lot of people-centered obstacles on it. Elwood stoped. He was having trouble, I thought, with a pole. Yes,there was a pole. It also turned out there was a hole.My right foot went in. Fortunately, the hole had a bottom and didn't go to China before coming to the end. I scraped my shin on the concrete and made Elwood take note of the hole. Then we went to the corner. Elwood was quite anxious. The day before he had rammed me into the planter there. The sidewalk is narrow so navigation is treacherous.

I checked the hole out with Sally. It had been filled in, not concreted over, just filled with dirt.

Today Sally called. She had first read in the newspaper and then checked it out in person ... The building with the planter, it's been torn down and will become a parking lot. The sidewalk is blocked off. 

"I'll tell Elwood he doesn't have to worry about the planter anymore," I said.

With the current Lucy fest underway--I think this is her birthday celebration--3rd is out and now 2nd is off limits. It looks like it's 4th St. To get to Washington if it gets cool enough to take our long walk. Hot, hazy, humid with a chance of thunderstorms for the next week.</p></body></html>
