I came home and started working on getting owncloud working.

1. I got lighttpd up and running.
2. I also have owncloud installed and the admin account configured.
3. I need to fiddle a bit more with the *php.ini* file.
4. I have to set up

   a. My user account.
   b. My files.
   c. Clean up the storage drive.


The drive is a mess. I need to connect it to a gui and just move stuff around and reorganize it for owncloud 7.0.2.1.
