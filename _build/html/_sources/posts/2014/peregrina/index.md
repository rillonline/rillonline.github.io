Yesterday we began our first semester of the Hour Glass Bible Study for the Church School Season. Currently, we are studying 1 Peter.

I always give my study short shrift. i don't like that about myself so I am starting a very ambitious project.

I would like to write a 1,000-word sermon based on our reading for this week and do this every week. A "flash" sermon would last ten minutes and be four double-spaced pages.

I can't cover the two chapters assigned for this week. i can only pick out one idea and develop it.

For 1 Peter 1-2 I have decided on the word *pilgrim*. In keeping with my Spanish language interest, I call this flash sermon Peregrina, the Spanish word for pilgrim.

As an adjective, *peregrino* means *odd* or *migratory*. As a noun it means *pilgrim* which in turn means *foreigner* or *way farer*. There is a lot of richness here to work with.

In English, *peregrin* is also an adjective meaning *foreign*, *alien*, *roving
* or *migratory*, *coming from abroad*, *nomadic* or *unsettled*. And, of course, there's the peregrin falcon which is a swiftly flying bird. 

Tomorrow I will look for the ways in which 1 Peter describes the faithful as pilgrims. I already know that other translations use the word *exiles*.
