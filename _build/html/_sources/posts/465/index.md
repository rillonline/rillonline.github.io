<html><body><p>I am happy to report that I will be going to the <a href="https://seeingeye.org">Seeing Eye</a> at the end of July to train with a new dog.</p>

<p>This interim time has been very difficult for me.</p>

<ul>
<li>I really miss Elwood. (For his part, Elwood is thoroughly enjoying retirement even more than I expected.)</li>
<li>Working with a cane if very frustrating.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, I am learning the Blind Square app and striking out on my own, joining a second yoga class and getting there on my own.</p></body></html>
