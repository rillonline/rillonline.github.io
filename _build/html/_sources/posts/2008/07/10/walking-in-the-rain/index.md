<html><body><p>We went out for dinner at Qudoba to celebrate Melanie's birthday. Afterwards, we walked outside. The band played Celebrate. Then thunder and a downpour. Melanie had an umbrella. Half of Melanie was under the umbrella. Half of me was under the umbrella. None of J. or Elwood was under the umbrella. When we got inside, J. went to dry his hair. We looked at a few things in the mall then went to Barnes and Noble for a coffee and to get warm and a little dryer. AFterwards we picked up a few things at Trader Joe's. Now we are home. Elwood got dried off and we are a bit dryer, too.Â </p></body></html>
