<html><body><p>This morning Elwood and I took out the trash and the recycling. Lots of odds and ends. He sat quietly while I got everything into the right dumpster. Then we took boxes down to the basement. This is a bit awkward since there are the stairs, the boxes and us. I ended up having him sit inside the basement while I maneuvered the boxes inside. The door is heavy and spring-loaded so that it remains loccked. I didn't want to catch any part of him in the door. Then I manuevered the boxes around the corner and picked him up to go to the storage unit. Then Elwood sat quietly again while I stowed them. It's so impressive, this waiting patiently and not going off about dog business. 

My stove was repaired. A screw was missing or misaligned so that I couldn't just pop it in. The shelf in the bedroom closet was flipped to avoid splinters and the right socket for the bedroom switch was located. I didn't realize that the particular socket of the outlet was key though I had identified the correct outlet initially. The thermostat and hooks will be done when maintenance returns from vacation. This is more important for cold weather though it is cool today. It is supposed to be hot but isn't yet. All in all, after two weeks, there is a lot of progress.</p></body></html>
