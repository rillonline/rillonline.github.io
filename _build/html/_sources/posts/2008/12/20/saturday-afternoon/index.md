<html><body><p>The groceries arrived today. They could not be delivered yesterday because of the snowstorm. It is snowing again today and is supposed to get very, very cold. A young man came and was very helpful. The woman at the coop was also very helpful. She is sensible. When one kind of potatoes was not available, she substituted another working under the assumption I would need them. If I did't want these more expensive potatoes, I could return them. I had asked that one kind of soy milk be separated in a different bag from the other kind of soy milk. That was done. Of course one always has to figure out the bulk items and which bottle is which--salsa or salad dressing? The salad dressing came in a bottle I would have identified as Worcestershire sauce or the like but since I didn't order that, it must be the salad dressing.   I'm still guessing with items like garlic and celery--how many pounds or ounces to order. The powdered vanilla has that slightly metallic smell to it.

Elwood has been up to no good. He was sick the other day. Poor dog. Poor me who had to clean it up. Then, when making the bed, I discovered the problem. He had chewed up my blanket. Fortunately, I can still use he blanket, but I'm not a happy camper. At least it wasn't the down comforter. And I can't scold him either as it was some time before I realized what was chewed up though I had a suspicion it was something made from cloth.</p></body></html>
