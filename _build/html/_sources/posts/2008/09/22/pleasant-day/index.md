<html><body><p>Sunday I went out to lunch with my ride and some family members. Not all the people in the "family" are directly related to one another which makes it remarkable that they consider themselves family. I had the opportunity to review a Braille menu which was not only incomplete in the meals offered but some of the words were cut off. The folks were startled that the Braille did not follow the large print. I was surprised they thought it would as they are different sizes. Afterwards, we stopped at the farmer's market at my corner. I was able to pick up some vegetables for the week. The carrots are all knobby and odd sizes which makes them fun. I decided to offer one to Elwood as a treat. I think he was quite shocked about it though he didn't refuse it and went off to enjoy it. After church I got some apples, too, which were from an orchard though how they arrived and what the distribution method was I did not learn. One of my lunch companions offered to go thrift store shopping with me later in the week. We will firm things up at the Wednesday night dinner. One of my Bible study companions came to chat after church. It was nice to recognize a few people.</p></body></html>
