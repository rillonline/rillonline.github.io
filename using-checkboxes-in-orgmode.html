I wrote about
[[<a href="https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2019/08/28/recurring-tasks-in-orgmode/p">https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2019/08/28/recurring-tasks-in-orgmode/p</a>][Recurring Tasks in Orgmode] previously. Once I had this to-do working properly,
I went onto the next task. I wanted to list my ideas for articles and
bigger writing projects. In my opinion, I did not need to set this all
up as a big list of to-dos. That certainly becomes overwhelming to
me.I might just stop writing altogether because the ideas keep coming
but the time and patience to write them may not be available at the
moment. I do
want to be sure I have a stash of ideas to choose from when I am able
to sit down and write out a complete article.
</p>

<p>
I created a file name "ideas.org". I inserted three headings:
</p>

<pre class="example">
* Writing Ideas Big and Small
** Blog Ideas [/]
** Bigger WRiting Projects [/]
</pre>


<p>
You may have noticed that at the end of the second level headings
there are two square brackets "[]" enclosing a slash "/". More on this
later.
</p>
<div id="outline-container-org8dc4c72" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org8dc4c72"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Organizing the list</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
At first I thought I would just write a list like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
- smart quotess and other typography
- less than shortcuts in orgmode
- Braile pack at public museum
- photo op with Nick
- a walk in the park with Nick
- using org capture
- Using checkboxes in org
</pre>


<p>
Then I thought about using checkboxes so I could check them off as I
went. Now this section of the file looks like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
- [ ] smart quotess and other typography
- [ ] less than shortcuts in orgmode
- [ ] Braile pack at public museum
- [ ] photo op with Nick
- [ ] a walk in the park with Nick
- [ ] using org capture
- [ ] Using checkboxes in org
</pre>


<p>
Who knows, you might even see some of these articles in the future!
</p>

</div>
<div id="outline-container-org75dcf5c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org75dcf5c"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Why Use Checkboxes?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Why use checkboxes? After all, I could simply delete the item from the
file once I published it.
</p>

<p>
It's a good point. I decided to try this methodology just to see how I
liked it and for two other reasons:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It would let me know how I was doing at keeping up with my ideas.</li>
<li>It would let me know if I needed to be thinking more about writing
opportunities.</li>
</ol>

<p>
It seems to me that a writer is stuck here: Coming up with ideas and
getting them written.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgb071d78" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb071d78"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Using the Checkboxes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
To check off an item, press "c-c c-c" on that line. Then you have:
</p>

<p>
:- [X] Using checkboxes in org
</p>

<p>
Here's what the heading now looks like:
</p>

<pre class="example">
** Blog Ideas [1/7]
</pre>


<p>
If I turn the "/" (slash) into a percent sign (%) it looks like this:
</p>

<p>
:** Blog Ideas <code>[14%]</code> 
</p>

<p>
If I feel ambitious, I can delete these lines or I can sort them so
that all the unchecked boxes are together.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgfba8228" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgfba8228"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Sorting Lines</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Highlight the list</li>
<li><p>
Type "m-x sort-lines". All the checked off items will be gathered
together at the end of the list. The items appear in alphabetical
order.
</p>

<pre class="example">
- [ ] Braile pack at public museum
- [ ] a walk in the park with Nick
- [ ] less than shortcuts in orgmode
- [ ] photo op with Nick
- [ ] smart quotess and other typography
   - [ ] using org capture
- [X] Using checkboxes in org 
</pre>


<p>
This list now is in a different order than the way I originally
wrote it down. I can read through it until I come to an item with a
checkbox. I know there are no more new items.
</p></li>

<li><p>
If I want to sort in reverse order, I type: "c-u m-x sort-lines".
Here is what I now have:
</p>

<pre class="example">
- [X] Using checkboxes in org
- [ ] using org capture
- [ ] smart quotess and other typography
- [ ] photo op with Nick
- [ ] less than shortcuts in orgmode
- [ ] a walk in the park with Nick
- [ ] Braile pack at public museum
</pre>


<p>
I don't think I will use this ordering unless I need a confidence
boost. I would have to go past everything I've already done.
</p></li>
</ol>
