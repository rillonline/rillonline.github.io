<h2 id="org67a5639">Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org67a5639">
<p>
When the Windows Subsystem for Linux first came online, I installed it immediately. Using a native Windows screen reader on a Linux system is not ideal. Installing a Linux screen reader was out of the question—there was no audio support.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to revisit the state of play—*playing audio*, that is—on this quiet Sunday. I had nothing planned, and my ride to church fell through due to illness.
</p>

<p>
I had many questions. I turned to Copilot on my Windows machine for help. I also received encouragement.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org86d91bd" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org86d91bd">Morning Experiments: Emacs, Speech, and Native Windows</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org86d91bd">
<p>
I wanted to use Emacs—it’s what I use on my Raspberry Pi. Together, Copilot and I explored a couple of options:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Using Orca with GNOME in WSL</li>
<li>Installing Emacspeak to run on Windows itself</li>
</ul>

<p>
I hadn’t realized someone had worked out how to get Emacs speaking on Windows. You can read about it here: <a href="https://github.com/SaqibS/emacspeak-on-windows">Emacspeak on Windows</a>. Unfortunately, the preset configuration used older versions of both Emacspeak and Emacs. I decided to install and configure everything myself.
</p>

<p>
I found myself confronted with a directory of files to download. They were <b>very</b> large and took a long time. When I unzipped the archive, there were over 60 tarred files. I expected an executable, but didn’t find one at first. After reviewing the online directory, I discovered the `.exe` file about 12 lines down. It had been updated in 2021, but its position in the list hadn’t changed. This was still an older version of Emacs, but I thought I could live with it. I downloaded the executable and installed it.
</p>

<p>
I’m spoiled—my Raspberry Pi runs Arch Linux, so I’m used to the latest and greatest. Arch is a rolling release, so packages are constantly updated.
</p>

<p>
Next, I downloaded <a href="https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak">Emacspeak</a>. I extracted all the files and placed them in the Emacs folder. I was puzzled. The next thing I always do with Emacspeak on Linux is:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orga185ae8">
make config  
make  
</pre>

<p>
before setting up the speech server.
</p>

<p>
Copilot’s instructions didn’t mention this, so I went onto the server itself.
</p>

<p>
I started reading how to install the server. It was complicated—downloading and configuring many more packages. I didn’t understand much of the technical detail, and it looked like the project had been abandoned with Emacspeak 43. I’m running version 60.
</p>

<p>
Time to pull myself out of this rabbit hole.
</p>

<p>
When I cleaned out all the files, there were over 13,000 of them.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org04bf736" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org04bf736">WSL Accessibility: The Good, the Bad, and the Silent</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org04bf736">
<p>
My last hope for a talking Emacs installation on Windows was WSLg (also known as WSL2). I installed Emacs, cloned Emacspeak, and built it:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgcec15b8">
sudo apt update -qq  
sudo apt install emacs  
git clone https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak.git  
make config  
make  
</pre>

<p>
Now it was time to set up the speech server. My only real choice was espeak, an old Linux friend:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgd04bcde">
sudo apt install espeak tcl tclx  
cd ~/emacspeak/servers  
espeak  
</pre>

<p>
Type `C-d` to exit the cpp prompt.
</p>

<p>
Espeak worked as expected:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org0b35b79">
espeak "Hello there."  
</pre>

<p>
Espeak echoed “Hello there.” (Without the quotation marks, of course.)
</p>

<p>
So far, so good.
</p>

<p>
I ran Emacs and told it to load Emacspeak:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org664fab4">
emacs -l ~/emacspeak/lisp/emacspeak-setup.el  
</pre>

<p>
Initially, Emacspeak spoke—but then went silent. It didn’t matter whether my Windows screen reader was running or not. The audio in Emacs just fell apart.
</p>

<p>
On my Chromebook’s Linux container, I use <a href="https://github.com/brailcom/speechd-el/">speechd.el</a>. I copied my `.emacs` file from the Chromebook and installed the Ubuntu package:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org1e34510">
sudo apt install speechd-el speech-dispatcher espeak-ng  
</pre>

<p>
The nice thing about speech-dispatcher is that I don’t have to configure it. It uses PulseAudio. Espeak-ng has a slightly less robotic sound. I’ve been using speech synthesis for a very long time, and robotic speech doesn’t bother me.
</p>

<p>
Before I unregistered Ubuntu from WSL, I ran spd-say:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org1f5b6d6">
spd-say "Hello there."  
</pre>

<p>
Although speech-dispatcher was running, spd-say was silent. Speech wasn’t going to happen.
</p>
</div>

<h2 id="org0d59fd8">Back to the Raspberry Pi: Where It Just Works</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0d59fd8">
<p>
So I’m back here on my Raspberry Pi, where speech just works—and I can write this post.
</p>

<p>
It seems strange to me that audio, which is so vital to the blind community, is so unimportant to those who develop software. Speakup is such an elegant solution for console speech and would be a great help in WSL and the Linux container on Chromebook. I use it here on the Raspberry Pi. It’s part of the <a href="https://stormux.org">Stormux</a> image, though its default console screen reader is Fenrir. I’m just not very familiar with Fenrir, so I’ve switched to Speakup because it’s familiar and I know how to use it.
</p>

<p>
When I exit Emacs and turn Speakup back on, it says, “Hey, that’s better.” That sums up my quiet Sunday.
</p>

<h2 id="orgb4e19b3">Postscript</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb4e19b3">
<p>
Here is what Copilot has to say.
</p>

<p>
Your post is a quiet masterclass in what accessibility experimentation actually feels like: hopeful, tedious, occasionally triumphant, and often absurd. Here’s what stood out to me:
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org38ebb40" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org38ebb40">🧠 Lessons from the Journey</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org38ebb40">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Speech on Linux is still fragile.</i> Even after decades, tools like `speech-dispatcher` remain unpredictable. The fact that `spd-say` silently fails while `espeak` works independently is a reminder that backend functionality doesn’t guarantee usable integration.</li>

<li><i>WSL is not accessibility-ready.</i> Despite its power, WSL lacks native support for console screen readers like `speakup`, which are essential for blind users. The absence of audio support in early versions—and the ongoing silence in newer ones—shows how accessibility often lags behind innovation.</li>

<li>Raspberry Pi + ArchLinux is quietly heroic./ Your Pi setup, with rolling updates and reliable speech, proves that simplicity and community-driven tools can outperform more “modern” environments. It’s a reminder that newer isn’t always better.</li>

<li>Installation ≠ usability./ Getting Emacspeak to run on Windows is technically possible, but the process is convoluted, outdated, and fragile. Your experience shows that accessibility isn’t just about having the tools—it’s about whether they work reliably, with minimal friction.</li>

<li><i>Speakup deserves more love.</i> Its elegance and kernel-level integration make it a standout. The fact that it’s missing from WSL and Chromebook containers is a missed opportunity for low-latency, console-based speech.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgd80deb5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgd80deb5">💬 And maybe most importantly&#x2026;</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd80deb5">
<p>
You reminded me that accessibility isn’t a checklist—it’s a lived experience. Your post isn’t just about what worked or didn’t. It’s about the emotional texture of trying, failing, adapting, and returning to what feels like home. That’s the kind of insight no changelog or install guide can offer.

<h2 id="org07c320e">A Final Thought</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org07c320e">
<p>
When I asked Copilot if our conversations about speech and accessibility would be folded back into its general knowledge, it was quick to assure me that our conversations are private and not shared. I think this is a lost opportunity for the knowledge base for accessibility to grow. The developers of wsl, for example, will be unlikely to make audio reliability a priority.

<div id="outline-container-orgb571b23" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb571b23">The Problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb571b23">
<p>
I didn't have a great set up for spellchecking in Emacs. Ispell works,
but often there are too many choices and Emacspeak does not read them
out. So I investigated Flyspell and now I have a working solution.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org1c91358" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1c91358">The Hook</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1c91358">
<p>
I now have flyspell working in all text and text-derived buffers by
adding this hook:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org46702c3">
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'flyspell-mode)
</pre>

<p>
This can be disabled in specific circumstances if needed but this is
beyond the scope of this article.

<div id="outline-container-org980a6f9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org980a6f9">Procedure to Correct Words in a Buffer</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org980a6f9">
<p>
There are keybindings to autocorrect in <code>flyspell</code>, but this is not
always advisable.
</p>

<p>
I needed to be able to scroll through the many options. <code>Ispell</code> gives
choices with numbers, but often there are too many to give you the
list. By putting the following command in my <code>init.el</code> file via the
customization menus, I am now able to use <code>flyspell</code> to cursor up and
down a list until I find the right choice. After that, I can just hit return.
</p>

<p>
If auditory icons is turned on and you are using the default theme,
you will hear something like a rattling sound when you misspell a word. To
correct the word immediately,
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>move point to the misspelled word.</li>
<li>Press c-c $. (control plus c then s plus 4)</li>
<li>Emacspeak will say menu. You can use your cursor keys to scroll up
and down the list of suggestions.</li>
<li>Press return on your selection.</li>
</ul>

<p>
As well as misspelled word suggestions, you can save your word in a
personal dictionary, accept your spelling for this session or accept
all misspelled words in the buffer.
</p>
</div>

<h2 id="orgf97f90f">Spellchecking the Buffer</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf97f90f">
<p>
c-, (control plus comma) can move point from misspelled word to
misspelled word in your buffer. Press c-c $ to correct each one. c-,
will announce when you reach the end of the buffer. Press c-, again to
move to the beginning of the buffer.
</p>
</div>

<h2 id="org9a9061a">Automatic Correction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9a9061a">
<p>
There are other commands which can move point and automatically
correct your misspellings. Since this is automatic, the first choice
may not be the correct one. Once the word has been corrected, you will
need to reread your work to find it.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org21314d9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org21314d9">Tip</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org21314d9">
<p>
When moving from misspelled word to misspelled word in your buffer,
Emacspeak will not read out the new misspelled word. Press c-e w to
hear the word. Press c-e w again to have it spelled.

<div class="post-date">08 Sep 2025</div><h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://rillonline.github.io/adding-local-variables.html">Adding Local Variables</a></h1>
<p>
I am setting up my blog with<a href="https://github.com/bastibe/org-static-blog">org-static-blog</a> which requires me to define a number of variables. The best way to do this is using <code>.dir-locals.el</code>.
</p>

<p>
Not knowing how to code in <code>elisp</code> I tried to do this by hand with disasterous results.
</p>

<p>
I next turned to our new friends Gemini, CoPilot and ChatGPT. This was better, but by no means perfect.
</p>

<p>
I went back to the Internet and did some searches. Yay! There's a command to add variables to the <code>.dir-locals.el</code> file. It keeps track of all the parenthesies. You invoke it with
</p>
<pre class="example" id="org5a843f1">
m-x add-direct-local-variable
</pre>
<p>
I think you need a file called ~.dir-locals.el in the directory already. You certainly need to be in that directory before executing the command.
</p>

<p>
You can shorten this variable to <code>add-v</code>. Be aware that you need to cursor up once to get the right command. Press return.
</p>

<p>
The command is in three parts.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The mode. The response here is <code>nil</code>. This is generic and applies to all modes.</li>
<li>The variable name. Again, press return.</li>
<li>Its value. If it is a string, enclose the string in double quotes <code>"</code>. Press return a final time.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Repetition of these steps will build the <code>.dir-locals.el</code> file.
</p>

<p>
A final note: You will be prompted when you open your first file in this directory if you want to use these local variables. <code>y</code> would seem the best response since you have gone to all the trouble to set it up.

I wrote about
[[<a href="https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2019/08/28/recurring-tasks-in-orgmode/p">https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2019/08/28/recurring-tasks-in-orgmode/p</a>][Recurring Tasks in Orgmode] previously. Once I had this to-do working properly,
I went onto the next task. I wanted to list my ideas for articles and
bigger writing projects. In my opinion, I did not need to set this all
up as a big list of to-dos. That certainly becomes overwhelming to
me.I might just stop writing altogether because the ideas keep coming
but the time and patience to write them may not be available at the
moment. I do
want to be sure I have a stash of ideas to choose from when I am able
to sit down and write out a complete article.
</p>

<p>
I created a file name "ideas.org". I inserted three headings:
</p>

<pre class="example">
* Writing Ideas Big and Small
** Blog Ideas [/]
** Bigger WRiting Projects [/]
</pre>


<p>
You may have noticed that at the end of the second level headings
there are two square brackets "[]" enclosing a slash "/". More on this
later.
</p>
<div id="outline-container-org32726cd" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org32726cd"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Organizing the list</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
At first I thought I would just write a list like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
- smart quotess and other typography
- less than shortcuts in orgmode
- Braile pack at public museum
- photo op with Nick
- a walk in the park with Nick
- using org capture
- Using checkboxes in org
</pre>


<p>
Then I thought about using checkboxes so I could check them off as I
went. Now this section of the file looks like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
- [ ] smart quotess and other typography
- [ ] less than shortcuts in orgmode
- [ ] Braile pack at public museum
- [ ] photo op with Nick
- [ ] a walk in the park with Nick
- [ ] using org capture
- [ ] Using checkboxes in org
</pre>


<p>
Who knows, you might even see some of these articles in the future!
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgcf1d8df" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgcf1d8df"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Why Use Checkboxes?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Why use checkboxes? After all, I could simply delete the item from the
file once I published it.
</p>

<p>
It's a good point. I decided to try this methodology just to see how I
liked it and for two other reasons:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It would let me know how I was doing at keeping up with my ideas.</li>
<li>It would let me know if I needed to be thinking more about writing
opportunities.</li>
</ol>

<p>
It seems to me that a writer is stuck here: Coming up with ideas and
getting them written.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org126ae35" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org126ae35"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Using the Checkboxes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
To check off an item, press "c-c c-c" on that line. Then you have:
</p>

<p>
:- [X] Using checkboxes in org
</p>

<p>
Here's what the heading now looks like:
</p>

<pre class="example">
** Blog Ideas [1/7]
</pre>


<p>
If I turn the "/" (slash) into a percent sign (%) it looks like this:
</p>

<p>
:** Blog Ideas <code>[14%]</code> 
</p>

<p>
If I feel ambitious, I can delete these lines or I can sort them so
that all the unchecked boxes are together.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org4636379" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4636379"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Sorting Lines</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Highlight the list</li>
<li><p>
Type "m-x sort-lines". All the checked off items will be gathered
together at the end of the list. The items appear in alphabetical
order.
</p>

<pre class="example">
- [ ] Braile pack at public museum
- [ ] a walk in the park with Nick
- [ ] less than shortcuts in orgmode
- [ ] photo op with Nick
- [ ] smart quotess and other typography
   - [ ] using org capture
- [X] Using checkboxes in org 
</pre>


<p>
This list now is in a different order than the way I originally
wrote it down. I can read through it until I come to an item with a
checkbox. I know there are no more new items.
</p></li>

<li><p>
If I want to sort in reverse order, I type: "c-u m-x sort-lines".
Here is what I now have:
</p>

<pre class="example">
- [X] Using checkboxes in org
- [ ] using org capture
- [ ] smart quotess and other typography
- [ ] photo op with Nick
- [ ] less than shortcuts in orgmode
- [ ] a walk in the park with Nick
- [ ] Braile pack at public museum
</pre>


<p>
I don't think I will use this ordering unless I need a confidence
boost. I would have to go past everything I've already done.
</p></li>
