I have been trying to read a psalm every day. My Old Testament
professor Dr. Robinson said it would change my life. He said that
twenty years ago (that's a scary thought in and of itself). I've never
succeeded at doing this, but it's never too late to give it a shot. I
would read all the psalms twice through in one year.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've been suggesting we read a psalm at the end of our Bible study on
Thursdays. I don't do it every week, but it turns out one of the
participants doesn't like the psalms. I realized that reading one
every week allows us to work through all 150 psalms over time (three
years or so) without getting bogged down in the book of psalms. That
would make things easier for the participant who doesn't like them.
Someone is marking them off as we go.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is a long introduction to reading Psalm 64. I started at Psalm 61
because that is the psalm we read last Thursday and it seemed to be a
good place to start. The problem of embarking on such a task is that
I've read Psalm 1 a lot and never gotten very far after that.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I can't remember ever reading Psalm 64 before. No doubt I have, but
nothing stood out to mean. This morning, however, in the wake of the
terrible shootings at El Paso and Youngstown, I couldn't help thinking of
all those bullets or, as the psalmist put it, arrows. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
David is talking about words, not literal weapons, but it doesn't much matter in the
context of the psalm. Behind the bullets were evil words. And evil
words and hatred are at the crux of the problem in this country. It
there weren't so many evil words flying about like arrows, people
shopping on a Saturday morning for school supplies or going out for a
fun-filled evening wouldn't be dead–terrible! Unspeakable evil!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I take comfort in verse 8:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="verse"&gt;
Their own tongues shall ruin them.&lt;br&gt;
All who see them will shake their heads.&lt;br&gt;

This is a collection of short stories. This gave me hours of enjoyment
and I discovered many new authors. I was delighted to read the first
story by Steven Saylor about Gordianus the Fixer. Check it out at

Picture this. Ronnie, our intrepid heroine, is
sitting in the great library of the wizards in the heart of Magic
City. (I know. I know. These names are not very imaginative and need
changing, but it is the best I can do right now.) Anyway, she is
sitting in the library not because she wants to be there but because
she is compelled to be there. The Tribunal of All Wizards (Is this a
better name?) has sentenced her to serve there for some unspecified
length of time. She goes to the library at the pleasure of the Grand
Mistress of Wizards who doesn't like her to begin with. Ronnie is
fulfilling her sentence for the misuse of magic which caused the death
of her mentor, Grand Master Awk.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Although Ronnie is unhappy that she must remain in the Magic Lands for
perhaps the rest of her life, she makes the best of being confined to
the library and her living quarters for most of every day. As
imprisonments go in the inhabited galaxy, it is a very lenient
sentence.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The wizards did not come up with this punishment without
reason. Ronnie has shown an aptitude for magic. The wizards hope she
can learn to read and understand the books stored in the library which
they cannot even open. Ronnie thinks their hope in her is
misplaced. Even if she can open a book, why do they think she can read
an ancient script and make sense of it. She does not possess these
skills.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Neverthe less, she goes to the library and tries to open every book on
every shelf. There are many thousands of books.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Then one day Ronnie lugs a very large volume to the library table by
the window. It has a pleasant view of a garden. She sets the tome
down. What else can she possibly call the book but a tome. It is
dusty. Its binding shows much wear. She wonders just how old this book
is and what sort of a book this is. There are no pictures on the
covers. The script on its binding is beautiful and perhaps contains
grains of precious gems. This is not her expertise either but the
script seems to sparkle.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With no expectations at all, she tries to open the book. And it
opens.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Ronnie gasps. The librarian, working at his desk across the room,
looks up to see the book open and hurries over.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"Can you read it?" he asks rather breathlessly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"Can you see the pictures?" Ronnie asks him.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"The page is blank," the librarian responds, puzzled.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"No, it is not," Ronnie says. "It is a beautifully done star chart."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
They stand in silence. Ronnie can see it while the librarian cannot.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"A star chart of what?" the librarian finally asks.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"I don't know," Ronnie says. "I would need a modern star chart and a
way to evaluate procession and drift. I don't recognize any of these
stars, but I am not from around this part of the galactic arm. The
constellations look all wrong to me."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"Can you copy the chart?" the librarian asks quickly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"Let's see if I can," Ronnie says.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Then she smiles. "If this is a map to treasure, I claim it by virtue
of being able to read the map."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The librarian does not see the humor in her claim but hurries away to
get paper and writing implements. He also calls the Grand Mistress and
she comes to hover over Ronnie's shoulder.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After Ronnie's crude representation of the beautiful chart and much
discussion, the Tribunal corrects the star chart for this time
period. They show it to Ronnie.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"It's Planet X," she says, pointing to a particular
constellation. I've been there."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In an earlier unpublished adventure, she and Captain Star Runner visited this
forbidden planet with disastrous results.

Jeroboam II had a 40-year reign. During that time, the country
prospered. Reading through the Book of Amos, it is clear that only
some were doing well. Granted, Amos was from Judah and the Lord
sent him. Setting aside the question of worshiping God outside of
Jerusalem and the synchronistic character of temple worship in Israel,
Amos inveighs against personal excess and unethical business
practices. Israel is rotten at its core, straying far from the
precepts God has prescribed for the people in their interpersonal
relationships and societal responsibilities for the poor and needy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It is astounding that twenty-five years after Jeroboam II's death,
Israel fell to the Assyrians. Assyria forcibly deported many to the
far reaches of its empire, effectively dispersing Israel's people so
that ethnic and religious identity of the people evaporated as they
were absorbed by other cultures and religions. Although the land
remained, Israel and its people were absolutely gone except in
the prophetic imagination.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What makes reading Amos so disturbing are the parallels to our own
country and culture. How close to annihilation are we? Could life as
we know it come tumbling down as quickly as it did for the people of
Israel?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Who will stand up and prophesy to the people and will anyone believe
God's prophet? Or are we doomed to repeat  the experience of ancient Israel?
&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2019/07/12/more-thoughts-on-amos-7/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2019 20:27:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Finding Good News in Amos and Psalm 82</title><link>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2019/07/11/finding-good-news-in-amos-and-psalm-82/</link><dc:creator>Rill</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
These are the Hebrew Scripture readings for July 14, 2019 in the
United Methodist Church.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am not preaching, but a friend asked me to find good news in Amos
7:1-17 (the whole chapter). Here's what is going on:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class="org-ol"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things are going well in Israel. The economy is humming
along. Business is good. There are no imminent threats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Israel has set up a variant of worship within its borders, not
supporting, going to or wanting to worship in Jerusalem in the
kingdom of Judah.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite the good economy and the absence of threats foreign or
domestic, the poor are suffering. Trickle down economics didn't work
then either and many of them are being cheated when they buy goods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God sends Amos, whose name means &lt;i&gt;burden-bbearer&lt;/i&gt; to prophesy.
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amos is from Judah.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amos is not a professional prophet. He has not attended prophet
school. (Yes, they had them back then.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amos seems himself as a shepherd and a sycamore tree farmer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Common English Bible (2010) agrees with my Old Testament
professor who insisted that Amos speaks about himself in the
present tense. He still tends sheep and fruit trees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The word is bad for Israel and particularly Amaniah in this chapter,
but the good news is directed to God's championing the poor. Things
are out of alignment in Israel. That is why God shows Amos the plumb
line. Measure Israel. See how askew it is. It needs to be brought back
to plumb, to act, as Micah puts it, like this: "… to do justly, to love mercy,
and to walk humbly with your God" Micah 6:8b NKJV).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Amos bears the burden of speaking God's word in a foreign country to
hostile audiences. He does it because he is obedient to God's call and
because the people of Israel are God's people, too.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Psalm 82 is subtitled, in my New King James Version of the Bible, &lt;i&gt;An
Appeal to Justice&lt;/i&gt;. When we cannot bring things into plumb, we ask God
to do it. We are confident that God will do it even if it is not on
our time table.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The psalmist says"All the foundations of the earth are unstable"
(Psalm 82:5c NKJV).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In the Gospel for Sunday, Jesus shows how the good Samaritan behaves
towards the helpless man and
declares that he has fulfilled the law to love his neighbor as
himself. The Samaritan was able to do this:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tend the injured man's wounds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring him to the inn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage the innkeeper to continue to care for the injured man&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promised to reimburse the innkeeper for any expense above what the
Samaritan had already paid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Sometimes the fix is beyond our individual or collective ability. Then
we appeal to God for the justice we are unable to deliver.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is not an excuse. It is a reality.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Anaziah and Jeroboam were powerful men.  As such, God  charged them to
care for the poor and needy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
God's charge has not changed. Providing safe and sanitary conditions
for migrants at our southern border is not a political matter. God has
charged us to care for those who are in need and for the sojourner
among us. It is a question of carrying out the will of God–Thy will
be done.

I was going to participate in &lt;a href="https://www.campnanowrimo.org/"&gt;Camp Nanowrimo&lt;/a&gt; this year. I like bbbsetting a low writing goal and meeting it. Call it childish if you like, but positive reinforcement is fun.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But I wanted to do something more than just write a first draft and so I was leery of making a commitment I couldn't keep. Again, seeing a congratulatory message on my screen is quite satisfying.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here's what I really want to do:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit my Kearsarge novel. I wrote it as part of &lt;a href="https://www.nanowrimo.org/"&gt;Nanowrimo&lt;/a&gt; some time ago and have never finished an edit. I would like to be able to give it to an editor and create an ebook out of it with a cover and everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish Kearsarge to my &lt;a href="https://rillonline.github.io"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; site with each chapter as a separate web page linked together. (Right now, I don't know how to do this. I am refreshing my knowledge of orgmode and learning new features.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finish writing my memoir piece on Chance so that Cindy can look it over before I send it off to Joy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have already set up &lt;a href="https://www.getnikola.com/"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt; to deploy my blog and associated pages to &lt;a href="https://www.github.com/"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2019/07/04/no-camp-nanowrimo-this-month/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jul 2019 15:11:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Sixth Day</title><link>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/527/</link><dc:creator>Rill</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rabbinic sage Resh Lakish once wondered why the Hebrew text in Genesis used a seemingly superfluous definite article in the phrase “And it was evening and it was morning, the sixth day.” (The definite article is not used for the preceding five days.) He took this to be a hidden reference to the sixth day of the month of Sivan, when according to tradition the Torah was given to Israel: “to teach us that the Holy One made a condition with all created things, saying to them, ‘If Israel accepts the Torah, you will continue to exist. If not, I shall return you to welter and waste’” (Babylonian Talmud: Shabbat 88A&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/527/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 26 Feb 2019 20:58:14 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Coffee and Nehemiah</title><link>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2019/01/10/525/</link><dc:creator>Rill</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sat down today with Paul and later Jason to discuss my texts for January 27th. I primarily wanted to talk to Paul about Nehemiah 8 and if my analysis of the text was consistent with his understanding of Nehemiah and its place in the history of Israel. Paul is a thoughtful student and teacher so I learned a great deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jason joined us after his meeting, I explored the practicalities of preaching at St. Luke's. Jason's sermons are about 7 minutes long. I'm used to having more time to develop my sermon so cutting back to between 700 and 1000 words will be challenging. I am starting to think of this as my flash sermon as flash fiction stories are no longer than a thousand words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a basic summary of what we worked out today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 7 days, the people (which includes women and children as well as men) here the Torah read aloud. There are break out groups where the Levites translate and instruct small groups of the people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would appear that Ezra reads more than a law code but reads a great deal of the Torah. If you postulate he read for 3 hours and a person reads 30 pages an hour and he read for 7 days, that works out to 630 pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A further postulation is that Ezra started with Genesis and read through the Torah so that the people heard the entire story of God's saving work including fetching the people bak from Egypt and entering the promised land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people are in mourning but they are told to rejoice. This is a happy story because it is the account of God's faithfulness to the people, the story of his mighty acts to save.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nehemiah prays at the opening of the book that God continues to be faithful so that the people may not be scattered  again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Paul speaks to the Corinthians about being the body of Christ, being one body. Each person is important in their own right. The Corinthians wanted to compete with one another to have the best gifts but Paul tells them that each person in the  congregation  is equally important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus widens the idea of the congregation to include the captive and the disabled. All are welcome and all have gifts to share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a joyful task. The body grows. No one need be afraid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Witth 23% of Americans identifying as atheist or of no religion, there are lots of people to extend an invitation to. Our message is one of joy, that God's mighty acts continue and that our worship and community is joyful. We are not here to condemn and to mourn our shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are sent out with gladness and singleness of heart to share this joy with everyone we meet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2019/01/10/525/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jan 2019 01:42:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Giving Thanks </title><link>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2019/01/08/523/</link><dc:creator>Rill</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinking of Elwood and Eiffel today. They would have been 14. Linda and I gave thanks today for them. Through them we have had an enduring friendship by email and phone. Each of these dogs had a sense of humor and made us laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2019/01/08/523/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jan 2019 02:31:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Magic is Difficult</title><link>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2019/01/07/494/</link><dc:creator>Rill</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have really struggled with writing my next Ronnie Camberwell mystery. I was so pleased with myself about exploring magic, but magic has proved to be difficult. Magic has a cost and although I have figured out what the cost is to Ronnie as a result of her careless attitude toward magic, I cannot figure out the cost of magic to the wizard on an ongoing basis. The wizards are just gifted with the ability to perform magic and beyond that, I don't know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've explored the political consequences and that doesn't seem to hold water. Exile would break a society apart. Inherited magic doesn't make sense either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I don't have a good reason for wizards to have the ability to do magic to hang out together in the Magic Lands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my mind, the Magic Lands feel very medieval. Perhaps this is just a trope. On the other hand, I have always felt there is something cinister about the place, as if it itself is held fast by a very powerful spell. Who does the work around here? Are they slaves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is just no energy or enthusiasm to write this story.  I might have to recast it and I started to do this by introducing Captain Star Runner into the plot line. I want to develop something which involves these two characters to write regularly this winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2019/01/07/494/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jan 2019 06:08:02 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
