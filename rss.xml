I was going to participate in &lt;a href="https://www.campnanowrimo.org/"&gt;Camp Nanowrimo&lt;/a&gt; this year. I like bbbsetting a low writing goal and meeting it. Call it childish if you like, but positive reinforcement is fun.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But I wanted to do something more than just write a first draft and so I was leery of making a commitment I couldn't keep. Again, seeing a congratulatory message on my screen is quite satisfying.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here's what I really want to do:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit my Kearsarge novel. I wrote it as part of &lt;a href="https://www.nanowrimo.org/"&gt;Nanowrimo&lt;/a&gt; some time ago and have never finished an edit. I would like to be able to give it to an editor and create an ebook out of it with a cover and everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish Kearsarge to my &lt;a href="https://rillonline.github.io"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; site with each chapter as a separate web page linked together. (Right now, I don't know how to do this. I am refreshing my knowledge of orgmode and learning new features.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finish writing my memoir piece on Chance so that Cindy can look it over before I send it off to Joy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have already set up &lt;a href="https://www.getnikola.com/"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt; to deploy my blog and associated pages to &lt;a href="https://www.github.com/"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2019/07/04/no-camp-nanowrimo-this-month/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jul 2019 15:11:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Sixth Day</title><link>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/527/</link><dc:creator>Rill</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rabbinic sage Resh Lakish once wondered why the Hebrew text in Genesis used a seemingly superfluous definite article in the phrase “And it was evening and it was morning, the sixth day.” (The definite article is not used for the preceding five days.) He took this to be a hidden reference to the sixth day of the month of Sivan, when according to tradition the Torah was given to Israel: “to teach us that the Holy One made a condition with all created things, saying to them, ‘If Israel accepts the Torah, you will continue to exist. If not, I shall return you to welter and waste’” (Babylonian Talmud: Shabbat 88A&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/527/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 26 Feb 2019 20:58:14 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Coffee and Nehemiah</title><link>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2019/01/10/525/</link><dc:creator>Rill</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sat down today with Paul and later Jason to discuss my texts for January 27th. I primarily wanted to talk to Paul about Nehemiah 8 and if my analysis of the text was consistent with his understanding of Nehemiah and its place in the history of Israel. Paul is a thoughtful student and teacher so I learned a great deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jason joined us after his meeting, I explored the practicalities of preaching at St. Luke's. Jason's sermons are about 7 minutes long. I'm used to having more time to develop my sermon so cutting back to between 700 and 1000 words will be challenging. I am starting to think of this as my flash sermon as flash fiction stories are no longer than a thousand words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a basic summary of what we worked out today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 7 days, the people (which includes women and children as well as men) here the Torah read aloud. There are break out groups where the Levites translate and instruct small groups of the people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would appear that Ezra reads more than a law code but reads a great deal of the Torah. If you postulate he read for 3 hours and a person reads 30 pages an hour and he read for 7 days, that works out to 630 pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A further postulation is that Ezra started with Genesis and read through the Torah so that the people heard the entire story of God's saving work including fetching the people bak from Egypt and entering the promised land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people are in mourning but they are told to rejoice. This is a happy story because it is the account of God's faithfulness to the people, the story of his mighty acts to save.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nehemiah prays at the opening of the book that God continues to be faithful so that the people may not be scattered  again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Paul speaks to the Corinthians about being the body of Christ, being one body. Each person is important in their own right. The Corinthians wanted to compete with one another to have the best gifts but Paul tells them that each person in the  congregation  is equally important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus widens the idea of the congregation to include the captive and the disabled. All are welcome and all have gifts to share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a joyful task. The body grows. No one need be afraid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Witth 23% of Americans identifying as atheist or of no religion, there are lots of people to extend an invitation to. Our message is one of joy, that God's mighty acts continue and that our worship and community is joyful. We are not here to condemn and to mourn our shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are sent out with gladness and singleness of heart to share this joy with everyone we meet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2019/01/10/525/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jan 2019 01:42:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Giving Thanks </title><link>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2019/01/08/523/</link><dc:creator>Rill</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinking of Elwood and Eiffel today. They would have been 14. Linda and I gave thanks today for them. Through them we have had an enduring friendship by email and phone. Each of these dogs had a sense of humor and made us laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2019/01/08/523/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jan 2019 02:31:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Magic is Difficult</title><link>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2019/01/07/494/</link><dc:creator>Rill</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have really struggled with writing my next Ronnie Camberwell mystery. I was so pleased with myself about exploring magic, but magic has proved to be difficult. Magic has a cost and although I have figured out what the cost is to Ronnie as a result of her careless attitude toward magic, I cannot figure out the cost of magic to the wizard on an ongoing basis. The wizards are just gifted with the ability to perform magic and beyond that, I don't know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've explored the political consequences and that doesn't seem to hold water. Exile would break a society apart. Inherited magic doesn't make sense either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I don't have a good reason for wizards to have the ability to do magic to hang out together in the Magic Lands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my mind, the Magic Lands feel very medieval. Perhaps this is just a trope. On the other hand, I have always felt there is something cinister about the place, as if it itself is held fast by a very powerful spell. Who does the work around here? Are they slaves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is just no energy or enthusiasm to write this story.  I might have to recast it and I started to do this by introducing Captain Star Runner into the plot line. I want to develop something which involves these two characters to write regularly this winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2019/01/07/494/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jan 2019 06:08:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>NO TITLE</title><link>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2018/08/03/503/</link><dc:creator>Rill</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today Nick and I celebrate our second anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick and I had a rocky start. I was originally matched with a different dog, Chance. Chance did everything I asked to do except go fast. I decided I didn't want to bring a dog home that would likely slow down and then I would be very frustrated. I asked for a new dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chance left in the morning. I went to lunch dogless. At lunch I learned one of the other students had to leave class due to an injury. I even passed him as he was leaving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my room, my instructor brought my dog to me. I was in love immediately--a yellow Labrador Retriever male--big and beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Full disclosure," my instructor said. "This was Stanley's dog."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always felt badly that in order to get Nick Stanley had to get hurt. If only he had received Chance and I was initially paired with Nick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know what this was all about-- Do things happen for a reason? Well, I've always been glad Nick was not paired with a newby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick has always been a difficult dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick doesn't like obedience. He remains a toddler. "Why?" Why do your want me to sit now? Why must I lay down? Once Nick figures this out for imself, he is quite willing to do so. He has finally figured that when people get up at the Sharing of the Peace at church, we are not preparing to leave the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick continues to be difficult to park. We go out. Nick does number one. Then Nick often is willing to start to go inside. Then he will literally make a U-turn and return to the grass for number two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick came home with an ear infection. I treated that. Soon afterwards, Nick's foot became infected. Licking. Licking. Licking. The vet decided he had a condition called Canine Atopic Dermatitis. I think of it as itching from the inside out. They tell me it is genetic. He is on a grain free diet which I must supplement with canned pumpkin and a laxative. My initial problems parking Nick may have been caused by Nick being so uncomfortable on grass. It is still amazing to me that Nick worked as well as he did with his medical issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick still goes fast. He has never slowed down. He marks his territory, sniffs poles, gets distracted by other dogs. I often wonder if he was a C student. He learns slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this said, I never thought about returning him. He was my forever dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is working here in the city, on buses, vans and busy city streets. He can see a route once and follow many turns inside a busy building. He is learning to talk to me about needing to park, about an empty water bowl and a late dinner. He is exploring talking to me when it is time to get up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a happy day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2018/08/03/503/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 03 Aug 2018 07:13:23 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>NO TITLE</title><link>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2018/07/16/501/</link><dc:creator>Rill</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of years ago my niece, Barbara, described me as one of the funniestpeople  she knew. (I took her to mean humorous rather than peculiar.) About that timefriends  started saying to me, "You ought to write a book," when I related a recent event in my life. I laughed and replied, "Do you really think so?" and then let the matter drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time later I became aware of the proliferation of the memoir. These books appeared to be extreme accounts of abuse or storiesfilled with juicy sexual details. I always got the impression critics despised them as they were not painstakingly written autobiographies replete with much deep reflection and soul searching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was soured on the idea of writing a memoir by Elizabeth Gilbert and Eat Pray Love. Gilbert is an award winning freelance journalist and author. She was given a $200,000 publisher's advance to write the book. The book did not grow out of Her travels but was intended from the first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although a nationally known journalist, Beth Finke's Writing Out Loud gave me a helpful perspective on what my own memoir might look like. Finke's piecesn are short incidents strung together over a number of years. They are satisfying because they feature recurring characters and their stories. Although there is an over-arching narrative of setting up writers' groups for older adults and Finke's anxiet yabout leading them, we are treated tomany satisfying vignettes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My other struggle with meoir is storytelling itself. My mother, and undoubtedly her mother before her, were magnificent storytellers in their own right. Their talent went unremarked. Even my grandmother's brother could spin quite a yarn. Uncle Arthur only had an eighth grade education and wrote without capitalization or punctuation. He always concluded letters to Gram with "your brudder," and did not sign his name. There were, after all, only the two of them. Who else would the letter be from? Uncle Arthur also was known for sending his sister unsigned birthday cards. The printed card had "to my sister" on the front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned to tell stories about the dinner table. Our custom was to recount the events of each day. We went in order: first my dad, then my mom, then me and finally my younger sister. Everyone was heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was thirteen, I won a creative writing contest. Mother insisted I call up one of the neighbors. His daughter was in my 4-H Club. I had visions of grandeur, writing novels about a life far more exciting and adventuresome than mine. Nat Hartshorne counseled me to write about myself. I could not imagine writing about that for over fifty years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am good in conversation to craft a retelling of an every day event in my own life. It might go something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there I was, standing on the corner. I knew I had the light and needed to give Nick the command to start across the street when I heard this siren. It was coming fast. I knew that vehicle was not going to stop for the light and, in truth, it did not. I stayed on the curb and waited for the next cycle before crossing."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My conversation partners thrill astounded. I perceive the world differently than they do. They try and fail to put themselves in my place. And yet, all I have done is said I waited for an emergency vehicle to pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I speak or write about myself in three to four sentence bursts. Longer essays illude me. They need context, background information and organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In high school, Mr. Cook read T. S. Eliot's poem, The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufroc to us. At one point in the poem Prufrock says, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am an attendant lord, one that will do†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To swell a progress, start a scene or two,†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deferential, glad to be of use,†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politic, cautious, and meticulous;†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At times, indeed, almost ridiculous--†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost, at times, the Fool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, Prufrock describes himselfas  not importan. He has a role to play and he plays it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how I think about my memoir pieces. I am the only one who can tell these stories, but the stories I tell are not overly importantt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2018/07/16/501/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jul 2018 04:58:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>NO TITLE</title><link>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2018/04/08/505/</link><dc:creator>Rill</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting Organized
I did not write yesterday. Even though my plan was to write every day, the only thing I wrote was a list of things to write today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I did do was purchase &lt;a href="https://red-sweater.com"&gt;MarsEdit&lt;/a&gt; so that I can fully access my [micro.blog(https://rill.micro.blog). The iOS app is not fully accessible; neither is the web site. This makes editing my posts difficult if not impossible after they are posted. With &lt;a href="https://red-sweater.com"&gt;MarsEdit&lt;/a&gt; I can work on my Mac and fix any mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I did not realize initially was that my blog posts were in plain text. My markdown was not working because I had not set up an "About" page. I will have to make sure they are now properly formatted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still pretty shaky with MarsEdit. I hope I can become more proficient in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am trying to write this post using my Braille display. It is quite hard at the moment because I am using&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a new app * my Mac * andthe Braille display&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am shaky using the Braille display connected to the Mac and I haven't consulted the documentation. Soon I will have to look up how to control the Mac with this device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later ... Markdown is working on the site. I used different ways of indicating unordered lists and different strategies for posting so the lists look different even in the same post:&lt;em&gt; simple lists * white bullets&lt;/em&gt; and regular bullets In any case, MarsEdit is working with my blog &lt;a href="https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2018/04/08/505/rill.micro.blog"&gt;rill.micro.blog&lt;/a&gt;. #BlogEveryDay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2018/04/08/505/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Apr 2018 01:21:51 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>NO TITLE</title><link>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2018/04/07/507/</link><dc:creator>Rill</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been another day at home&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no appointments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;very cold weather&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;lots of odds and ends to do&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what exactly did I do today?

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I created my shopping list in the Pick and Save app. Although it makes more sense to make a list instead of adding my items to the shopping cart, (I won't checkout from the cart.), the app is set up to add to the cart and it is an extra step, as far as I can tell, to add something to the shopping list. The cool thing about the shopping list is that you can check off the item presumably when you put it into your cart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I am buying more because I am able to peruse the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recorded a quick demo of the &lt;em&gt;Tunein Live&lt;/em&gt; Alexa skill for the Dot To Dot podcast. It is a paid skill with a 7-day free trial. It gives me access to Tunein premium content. I pay for this on my phone. (I pay a premium there.) It is a lot cheaper on my Amazon Echo. I started Tunein Premium originally because I had access to a variety of audio books as part of my subscription. I figured if I read a book a month I broke even. The books have been dropped from the program and I have been meaning to cancel my subscription. I can get my baseball games, but it is cheaper to use my dedicated MLB subscription. Besides, the baseball stream on my phone was not as reliable as the dedicated app. So why would I want to pay for &lt;em&gt;Tunein Live&lt;/em&gt;? I can stream some premium stations like Aljazeera English, C-Span and Young Turks.  It is far more likely that I will stream these at home rather than when I am out and about. I do drop into a baseball game when I have some down time when I am away from home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did the laundry. Laundry is manageable when the machines are in your home. When they are coin-operated and downstairs, they are barely tolerable. There is coming and going, setting timers and discovering that half the machines are out-of-order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I caught up with a young friend from guide dog school. It was good to hear her voice over audio messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I posted to Facebook to see how other guide dog handlers find bus stop poles. They mostly assured me that my dog would catch on if I use the bus frequently which I currently do not do. If I get the route to &lt;a href="https://vision-forward.ord"&gt;Vision Forward&lt;/a&gt; down, this may be the case. Whether Nick will start recognizing bus poles out in the wild remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2018/04/07/507/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Apr 2018 05:25:11 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>NO TITLE</title><link>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2018/04/06/516/</link><dc:creator>Rill</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my #BlogEveryDay goalssis to work on my Varioultra Braille Display and learn how to use it as a stand alone device. One of the display's strengths is the ability to copy and paste text from the notetaker into a text field on my iPhone or iPad. Unfortunately, the Unified English Braille translation is poor. 
&lt;em&gt; Periods translate as "dd".
&lt;/em&gt; Random periods are written after the "with", "and" and "for" contractions. 
&lt;em&gt; The "&lt;/em&gt;" becomes "in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I have switched to using the Braille display directly with my iPhone. We will see how this goes. I am still committed to using Unified English Braille rather than Grade 2 Braille. I figure that all new Braille will be in Unified English Braille and I want it solidly in my brain as I age. 
One of the fun things that came about using an app with markdown. I clicked on the preformatted link shortcut. I learned the left and right bracket signs in UEB as well as re-learning how to properly form a link. Everything looks different in Braille. That is what I get for spending my time writing markdown in Emacs on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2018/04/06/516/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Apr 2018 07:35:36 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
