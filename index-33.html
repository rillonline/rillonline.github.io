<p>Getting Organized
I did not write yesterday. Even though my plan was to write every day, the only thing I wrote was a list of things to write today.</p>
<p>What I did do was purchase <a href="https://red-sweater.com">MarsEdit</a> so that I can fully access my [micro.blog(https://rill.micro.blog). The iOS app is not fully accessible; neither is the web site. This makes editing my posts difficult if not impossible after they are posted. With <a href="https://red-sweater.com">MarsEdit</a> I can work on my Mac and fix any mistakes.</p>
<p>What I did not realize initially was that my blog posts were in plain text. My markdown was not working because I had not set up an "About" page. I will have to make sure they are now properly formatted.</p>
<p>I am still pretty shaky with MarsEdit. I hope I can become more proficient in the future.</p>
<p>I am trying to write this post using my Braille display. It is quite hard at the moment because I am using</p>
<ul>
<li>a new app * my Mac * andthe Braille display</li>
</ul>
<p>I am shaky using the Braille display connected to the Mac and I haven't consulted the documentation. Soon I will have to look up how to control the Mac with this device.</p>
<p>Later ... Markdown is working on the site. I used different ways of indicating unordered lists and different strategies for posting so the lists look different even in the same post:<em> simple lists * white bullets</em> and regular bullets In any case, MarsEdit is working with my blog <a href="posts/2018/04/08/505/rill.micro.blog">rill.micro.blog</a>. #BlogEveryDay</p>

<p>It has been another day at home</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>no appointments</li>
<li><p>very cold weather</p></li>
<li><p>lots of odds and ends to do</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So what exactly did I do today?

</p>

<ul>
<li>I created my shopping list in the Pick and Save app. Although it makes more sense to make a list instead of adding my items to the shopping cart, (I won't checkout from the cart.), the app is set up to add to the cart and it is an extra step, as far as I can tell, to add something to the shopping list. The cool thing about the shopping list is that you can check off the item presumably when you put it into your cart.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think I am buying more because I am able to peruse the store.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I recorded a quick demo of the <em>Tunein Live</em> Alexa skill for the Dot To Dot podcast. It is a paid skill with a 7-day free trial. It gives me access to Tunein premium content. I pay for this on my phone. (I pay a premium there.) It is a lot cheaper on my Amazon Echo. I started Tunein Premium originally because I had access to a variety of audio books as part of my subscription. I figured if I read a book a month I broke even. The books have been dropped from the program and I have been meaning to cancel my subscription. I can get my baseball games, but it is cheaper to use my dedicated MLB subscription. Besides, the baseball stream on my phone was not as reliable as the dedicated app. So why would I want to pay for <em>Tunein Live</em>? I can stream some premium stations like Aljazeera English, C-Span and Young Turks.  It is far more likely that I will stream these at home rather than when I am out and about. I do drop into a baseball game when I have some down time when I am away from home.</p></li>
<li><p>I did the laundry. Laundry is manageable when the machines are in your home. When they are coin-operated and downstairs, they are barely tolerable. There is coming and going, setting timers and discovering that half the machines are out-of-order.</p></li>
<li><p>I caught up with a young friend from guide dog school. It was good to hear her voice over audio messages.</p></li>
<li><p>I posted to Facebook to see how other guide dog handlers find bus stop poles. They mostly assured me that my dog would catch on if I use the bus frequently which I currently do not do. If I get the route to <a href="https://vision-forward.ord">Vision Forward</a> down, this may be the case. Whether Nick will start recognizing bus poles out in the wild remains to be seen.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>One of my #BlogEveryDay goalssis to work on my Varioultra Braille Display and learn how to use it as a stand alone device. One of the display's strengths is the ability to copy and paste text from the notetaker into a text field on my iPhone or iPad. Unfortunately, the Unified English Braille translation is poor. 
<em> Periods translate as "dd".
</em> Random periods are written after the "with", "and" and "for" contractions. 
<em> The "</em>" becomes "in.</p>
<p>So I have switched to using the Braille display directly with my iPhone. We will see how this goes. I am still committed to using Unified English Braille rather than Grade 2 Braille. I figure that all new Braille will be in Unified English Braille and I want it solidly in my brain as I age. 
One of the fun things that came about using an app with markdown. I clicked on the preformatted link shortcut. I learned the left and right bracket signs in UEB as well as re-learning how to properly form a link. Everything looks different in Braille. That is what I get for spending my time writing markdown in Emacs on Linux.</p>

<p>Today I worked with my mobility instructor to understand how to take the bus to <a href="http://vision-forward.org">Vision Forward</a>. I was relieved to learn that the bus stop near my apartment is easy to find. Both Nick and I were disappointed that I did not bring "you found the pole" treats with me. Blame the cold weather. The treats were in a lighter weight jacket.</p>
<p>As my instructor had another appointment after mine, I elected not to take the bus to the transfer point but to have him drive us there.</p>
<p>I get off the bus at the corner and then I have a choice:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>I can cross a busy street to get to the next bus stop. (There is a shelter there.)</li>
<li><p>I can walk down a fairly long block to find another bus stop. It is right at the cornerand very easy to find.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If the weather is good and there is time, walking a block sounds like a very easy solution to me. It also gives Nick a chance to relieve himself if necessary. Crossing busy streets is not always a comfortable option. It means listening very carefully to traffic changing direction when the light changes. With my moderate hearing loss in one ear (corrected by a hearing aid), I do not hear as well as I once did. Sometimes it is hard to pick up the surge of traffic and therefore have the full cycle to cross the street.

Afterwards, we simulated getting off the bus coming home from <a href="http://visionccforward.org">Vision Forward</a>.

Nick was doing well, but he wanted to check the bus shelter and was not particularly interested in finding the pole. Again, I could not bribe him with treats. I suspect he will come through on the day I actually make the trip.

I am looking forward to conquering this trip as I plan to be a frequent visitor to <a href="http://vision-forward.org">Vision Forward</a>. I can take Paratransit at a higher cost. This means sharing rides and possibly spending much more time onboard.</p>

<p>Today is Election Day in Wisconsin. My polling place is in my Community Room. No excuses. Go and vote in the Spring Election.</p>
<p>In the past, I have been very timid going into a new situation. Somewhere along the line, I have become more bold. I walked in and said, to no one in particular, "Hello." A woman directed me to someone who could help me register. I explained I was new to the city and needed to transfer my registration from another city in the state. Shockingly, I needed only to have lived for ten consecutive days at my current address. I am used to needing to live forty days in the county. I needed to show my ID and give my former address. I signed two papers:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>My new registration</li>
<li><p>Because my name was not in the book, the paper was necessary.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I decided not to have someone fill out my ballot for me. I used the talking voting machine for the first time. It took a little while to set it up. It is not used often.

I now know to bring my own wired headphones. I had to use the provided ones and the sanitation issues could be a concern. I had to adjust the volume and the speed of the speech. I wanted it loud and fairly slow so I could really understand what I was doing. This is an election after all.

Here in Wisconsin, we use paper ballots. The ballot is fed into the machine and there is a pause. I assume the machine is scanning the ballot.

After everything was set up, I listened to the instructions. The buttons are different shapes and large. Controls are labeled in Braille. I used a right arrow to move from contest to contest. I used the up and down arrows to review my selections. When I was done with each contest, I pressed the square button which is labeled with an s for select.

At the end, I had a chance to review my choices and hit the final select button.

There was a significant amount of clanking while the machine actually marked the ballot and then spit it out. After that, I just needed to insert it into the slot to be counted.

I left the poll with a "I voted" sticker, making sure it was right side up.

The poll worker remarked that we could at least get the sticker right side up because so much else in the world was up side down.

I wondered that she made such a reference. I did not think election workers could make any such comments.

When I was five I went with my mother to vote. The voting machines were mechanical. You step into the booth, close the curtain and pull down the levers associated with each of the candidates you want. When you are finished, you slide the curtain back. There is a wonderful mechanical sound as the votes are tallied. At the end of the day, the poll officials will open the back and get the vote count for each machine. I once brought two kids, one guide dog and mzf into the booth. That was certainly chummy.

Back to 1956.

A state trooper wasalw on duty at the polling place. (I don't know if Wisconsin has a police presence. I will have to inquire.) I knew the trooper. I went to school with his daughter. I went up to him and opened my coat in order to show him all the election buttons I was wearing.

This caused a commotion. Displaying the buttons is considered electioneering at the polls which is illegal so I had to close my coat very quickly.

I am certain one of the buttons was "I Like Ike". I have no idea what the others were. #BlogEveryDay</p>

<p>I think I have spent an hour this morning trying to work out why my iPhone was not speaking. Here is what I tried:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>I rebooted the iPhone several times.</li>
<li><p>I connected my Braille display and VoiceOver was working. If it was not on, the Braille display would not work. I turned VoiceOver on and off via Siri several times. When I turned VoiceOver off with the Braille display connected, my display on the Braille notetaker went blank.</p></li>
<li><p>I went into the Sound Settings and found the volume was at an acceptable level. I raised and lowered it. I was able to do this because VoiceOver spoke on this screen. When I left the sound settings screen, VoiceOver stopped speaking.</p></li>
<li><p>I went through all the VoiceOver settings. I could find nothing wrong. After all, the iPhone worked just fine when I plugged it in to charge before I went to bed.</p></li>
<li><p>I played with the mute switch. (I never remember which way is mute and which way is unmuted.) Unfortunately, the Internet does not tell you which way to click the mute switch to be unmuted. The only description I found referred to a red or orange strip which becomes visible when unmuted.</p></li>
<li><p>I searched the web. Nothing I found was particularly useful.</p></li>
<li>
<p>I tried to play an audio file. I heard nothing. This alarmed me. All sound was turned off somehow.</p>
<p>My phone turned off. I woke it up and reviewed the lock screen. I noticed information about my bluetooth headphones. Didn't I read something about this before? Why were my headphones coming up here anyway? They are in my pocketbook. I have not taken them out for days.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I went to find my bag.

I could hear the. audio file still playing. The problem resolved itself immediately: Sound was being directed through my headphones rather than through my speaker. I turned off the headphones and voila, sound came back to my iPhone. Why hadn't I thought of this before? It has happened before.

I did not think of it because I hadn't used the headphones for almost a week and my phone had worked fine yesterday. What changed?

If the crate belonged to my previous guide dog, I would blame Elwood. He was a sneak and. a cheat and I loved him dearly. Turning on my headphones by bumping my bag would have seemed just good fun to him. But Nick does not have that sort of humor. There is nothing sneaky about Nick at all. #BlogEveryDay</p>
