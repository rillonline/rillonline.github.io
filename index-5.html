<p>And in Tim Horton's, laying down quietly? Oh no, Merrill, I don't think so.</p>

<p>Today I read the Gospel at the Easter morning service at ST. Luke's. This meant walking from the chancel down the center aisle to the middle of the church. There was someone with the book and torchbearers, I think. Elwood did okay being part of the parade. Packs are good. When I came to the person holding the book for me to read, I stopped, stepped to the middle and told Elwood to lay down. </p>
<p>"Right here, in the middle of the aisle?" Elwood was quite shocked.</p>
<p>But he did what he was told and I proceeded with the reading. Then we had to step aside and let the procession procede us back to the chancel. This iwas a little shakier since we missed our seat but, no harm no foul.</p>
<p>It continues to snow and be cold. The priest almost wished us a Merry Christmas. It seemed more appropriate to the weather.</p>

<p>Dogs have a sense of humor. They do things and they're funny. I don't know if the intent is to make you laugh. I rather think it is to demonstrate how clever they are and how tuned into what humans intend to do they are.
</p>
<p>Today Elwood enacted one of those practical jokes dogs are so good at. I had been sorting the laundry, adding to a pile of clothes on the floor. When the pile was of sufficient size I intended to throw it into the washer. Well, this time arrived. I went to the pile only to discover a dog sprawled out on top of it. Ha~! Ha! I'm on the laundry you want to put into the washing machine. I don't know how he managed it. I was able to get all the laundry out from under him without Elwood moving. Maybe he moved when I was at the machine. I don't know. It's all mysterious.</p>

<p>While we still had warm weather, the fire alarm in my building went off. It was 10:30 at night. What to do? Was it just burned toast?
</p>
<p>I pulled on some clothes, got Elwood and my purse, and went down the back stairs. This seemed the most direct if not the easiest way out. Around threw the alley and up to the front of the building to find 4 or 5 emergency vehicles and my neighbors. They checked the building. There was the smell of paint or polyurethane but no fire. We all went back in.</p>

<p>Actually, it's a nightmare. Significant snow but now plowed. Cold. I had to drag out my heavy coat, boots, gloves and hat. Yuck! Especially since shirt-sleeve weather proceeded it.
</p>
<p>While the good weather lasted, Elwood and I were going on several walks a day which I thought would be good for both of us. He plagues me with his bone if he is not tired. I have been quite cross with him and of course he doesn't understand why. Then I feel bad and apologize and he goes and gets his bone again. It's hard to do anything when being poked with a bone. If I knew the game it would help. He is bringing his bone for outdoor play every time we go out--still.
</p>
<p>Last night we went to church, having gotten rides to and from. I could have never walked it with reasonable safety. When we got into the church, Elwood jumped up onto the pew cushion and began parading back and forth. I got him back down into the aisle. We entered the pew again and again Elwood jumped up and pranced on the pew. Someone offered the short pew where wheelchairs can be placed. No, we would get this right--dog on floor, person on pew. Three was the charm. He managed to do it right after coming back from Communion, too. What a relief. Now all we have to do is get through Easter morning church. We've never participated in the gospel procession before. At least there are no pews to jump on.</p>

<p>You may have heard of the pet food recall prompted by kidney failure in some dogs. As of this writing, the agent of the kidney failure in the food has not been identified. However, Elwood eats only dry food. It is the "wet" foods, puches and cans, that are effected.</p>

<p>A friend dropped by. Elwood ran to the door.
</p>
<p><q>Oh my goodness!</q> my friend exclaimed. <q>Elwood must have needed to go out. The carpet is now wet all down the hall.</q>
</p>
<p><q>That's funny,</q> I said. <q>He didn't pester me to go out which he normally would do.</q>
</p>
<p>Being a good friend, she went into the kitchen to get some paper towels and discovered the trail of liquid led to the water bowl. How odd. Then she looked at Elwood, still clutching his kong in his mouth which was still dripping water onto the carpet. No accident at all.
</p>
<p>The kong is designed in graduated rings with both top and bottom open. Some people hide treats inside especially peanut butter. Who would give a dog peanut butter I don't know. I can't stand the stuff.
</p>
<p>So now I know ... Elwood has the makings of a practical joker.</p>

<p>I buy breakfast sausage links. They're precooked and frozen. When I want sausage with my soft boiled egg in the morning, I take the package out of the freezer. The links are all lined up, five to a row and two rows in a package. With a knife, I break off how many sausages I want to microwave.
</p>
<p>This time, however, when I pressed down on the knife, one frozen sausage flew off the kitchen counter and landed in Elwood's water bowl.
</p>
<p>Now both dogs and people know the rules about food:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Anything that hits the floor legally belongs to the dog.</li>
<li>Anything in the dog's dish is definitely the dog's.</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, the frozen sausage in Elwood's water bowl was his. Rinsing something off which has fallen onto the floor is one thing. Retrieving food from a dog's bowl is another.
</p>
<p>So Elwood had a suasage popcycle for breakfast, after his own healthy dog breakfast.
</p>
<p>The only problem is-- He now watches closely any time I take more sausages out of the freezer. He will no doubt do this forever because, you never know, one may fly off the kitchen counter and land where it's legal to grab it.
</p>
<p>I'm just grateful I don't have sausage popcycles in my freezer for me. It just sounds yucky  though he was happy enough to crunch his.</p>
