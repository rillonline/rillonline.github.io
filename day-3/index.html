  <h3>God&rsquo;s Rant.</h3>

<h4>Reading</h4>

<p>Isaiah 58:1-12</p>

<p>I am imagining Mom standing in the family room, looking around at the kids and the mess. There are papers everywhere. Empty cans and bottles, pizza boxes, wrappers, half-eaten bags of potato chips. The homework is scattered about. Everyone is peering into their own screen.</p>

<p>Mom says, &ldquo;Clean this place up!&rdquo; and leaves. She runs some errands, Comes back in and says, &ldquo;The groceries are in the car. They need to be unloaded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nobody moves. Nothing happens. The kids continue to peer into their screens. In fact, the room looks worse than it did when Mom left.</p>

<p>Mom loses it and says, &ldquo;Is this what I told you to do? Didn&rsquo;t I tell you to clean up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seems to me that this is the very thing God is doing in this reading. The people  have out their sackcloth and their ashes. They&rsquo;re expecting all kinds of results from their fastin. Nothing&rsquo;s happening because God has not described fasting as an activity of ashes and sackcloth. God has seen the kind of fast that people need to be about is taking care of other people. They are taking care of themselves and basically doing everybody else in.</p>

<p>God says, &ldquo;Enough, I&rsquo;ve had enough. You people just don&rsquo;t seem to get it. Now let Me remind you again what a true fast is all about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It all boils down to taking care of the people less fortunate than yourself. And this may include your relative. God goes on to say that if you indeed do all these things, amazing things will happen. God likens it to a desert becoming a garden&mdash;a very appropriate metaphor for the Middle East.</p>

<p>One of the things we will be looking at in our Lenten journey is an opportunity to discern what sort of a fast God has in mind for each of usâ€”not one that means abstaining from food and putting on sackcloth and ashes, but of living the life and the spirit.</p>

<h4>Let us pray. ..</h4>

<p>O God, may I learn this Lent how you would have me walk by the spirit. Amen.</p>
