<html><body><p>Elwood went to the spa today. He hesitated about going in, but afterwards I was told he very much enjoyed his bath--all the attention and hugging. It turns out Elwood had 2 grease spots on either shoulder. He checks out the undersides of vehicles for some odd reason. The groomer's actual has degreasing shampoo. Apparently he is not the only dog to engage in this peculiar habit.

I forgot to check. We were on our way to the grocery store when Kathy said, "He brought his bone with him." So I relieved Elwood of the bone and had to carry it along the street and into the car. Elwood thought he might pick it up again and bring it with him into the store. I said not. HE doesn't hold onto it but drops it after a while and I didn't want it to get lost because he wouldn't learn the lesson about taking care of his stuff; he'd just be sad he had nothing to play with.</p></body></html>
