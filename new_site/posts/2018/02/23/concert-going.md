<html><body><p>The concert began. Nick has trouble laying down on command. I don't really know why. Perhaps he needs a good reason to do so. No amount of scolding or tugging on his collar has much effect. As a compromise Nick will accept, I work to get him to sit and hope he will eghentually sink to the floor. This has worked in the past at church in thepew.
After some time, Nick did lay down but popped up again as each grade exited the risers and a new group of children came in. Finally, I realized Nick's difficulty in knowing how to behave stems from his lack of experience. He had never been to a program like this before. He had no problem laying quietly on the floor while the African drums pounded out their rhythms or when people laughed at the antics on stage. The thunk thunk of the microphone in its stand didn't bother him. These distractions Nick understands. All my dogs have jumped up when there is applause, but they get used to it in time and ignore it.ick simply did not know what to expect and could not tell when the concert was over. And if nickDoesn't understand what is going on and what is expected of him, he is going to stand or sit up and evaluate the situation until he does .

Given his inexperience, Nick behaved very well and I anticipate his understanding of appropriate behavior will continue to grow with subsequent exposures to school programs and other child-based activities.</p></body></html>
