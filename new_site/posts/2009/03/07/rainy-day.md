<html><body><p>It's been very warm here. It won't last, of course. Much of the snow has melted. There are large expanses of water to walk through. Elwood and I have been able to take some long walks. We've gotten very wet. yesterday i was able to go out only in a sweatshirt. But today it rained and we did not go out. Elwood was very annoyed with me. I've been annoyed with my computer so we haven't been good company for each other.</p></body></html>
