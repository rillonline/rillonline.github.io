<html><body><p>The plane that crashed near Buffalo ... that was the run I made to and from the Seeing Eye re Elwood. I think it was Continental and that sort of plane. Scary and sad.</p><p>The women made cheese yesterday at C's house. Elwood lost his bone and we had to find it for him. We made mozzarella and marzipan. Marscarpone is made with either light cream or half-and-half. The half-and-half version is far too rich for me.</p><p>I got the prayers done. I had one day where I made good progress and then had to be fill in the gaps for a day or two. Glad that's done.</p><p>I was quite amazed. I was asked to do the pastoral prayer Sunday. I realized I wasn't sure what the visuals were about that, what the space looked like, etc. The service just flows and I don't analyze it when I'm following where it leads. I raised the question with my Bible study group since I figured that they had the info. They were quite touched and honored I had asked them. After wards we went over the space so all should be well for Sunday.</p><p>We had a good time last weekend celebrating Brian's birthday.</p><p>It's been warm but dreary here. Yes, you can put your lined Crocs through the washing machine. They're drying now. I don't know how long that will take. They took quite a beating on the mud luscious, puddle wonderful walk to and from the library.</p><br></body></html>
