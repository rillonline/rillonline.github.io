<html><body><p>Melanie and I went to Madison yesterday on the interstate. We passed the area that had been closed to flooding in June. The road runs through a swamp and it is still very, very wet. We also passed Johnson Creek where there is a large outlet mall: Gap, Old Navy, Land's End, Eddy Bowers, Calvin Cline and Ann Taylor. The bus from Madison to Milwaukee stops here. I also learned these outlets malls are owned by companies which manage them all over the country.

It is fairly simple to get to my apartment from the Belt Line, a major roadway that goes around Madison.

Signing the lease took a long time. In part, the owner/manager was thorough. In part, I had to sign a sublet and a year's lease. In part, Madison has a lot of special ordinances because of the number of student renters. For example, state law requires twelve-hour notice for the landlord to enter; Madison requires 24-hour notice. There are lots of regulations about who can occupy the premises and for how long. Obvious again when you think about students--and immigrants, too, for that matter. I became aware of the latter when I lived in Cilacon Valley in its hayday.

Then we got the tour. We were rushed because it took us longer to get to Madison than we expected and because Melanie had a church meeting to get back to. The owner wanted to "sell" the apartment, this after I had written checks. I gather pride is a factor here.

Some surprises for me: 

* I hadn't realized the apartment did not have a private entrance. No matter. The last apartment didn't have one either.

* The area is quite open and there are lots of trees. It feels like being in a residential area.

* The apartment is big.

Melanie kept saying you walk in a circle and I couldn't get it. The truth is you walk in off the hallway into a hallway. The bathroom which is small is on the left. It does have a linen closet--hurray! The kitchen is on the right. It's galley style and leads into the dining room. 

In the hall is a large coat closet and the bedroom is off this hallway. It's huge with a large walk-in closet. After having virtually no closets in Jamestown, it's close to heaven. 

There are windows in both the bedroom and the living room. The hall ends up in the living room. There are a set of narrow bookshelves here. The phone and cable jacks are on that wall, too, so it's a no brainer that cds, dvds, etc. will go into this bookcase. 

Here's the very cool thing. The extra window because the unit is on the end, is in the dining room. It makes the apartment very bright and feels very much like my condo in Twin Rivers. I wouldn't be surprised if the square footage was about the same. .

The wood in the kitchen cabinets will go well with the wood in the new table. Patience called that right.

The black chairs will show Elwood's fur, but that is how it goes. Cheers for lint rollers.

Elwood stuck his nose into everything he could.

We ditched the owner and skipped the tour of the dumpsters, basement storage and laundry. Time enough for that.

I also met the fulltime maintenance person. We'll get to know one another well since I am a pill about things and this seems okay. 

I checked the wireless availability from the kitchen. I'll need to subscribe to something. It looks like cable, at least for now, since dsl looks expensive and I don't need a phone. 

Having said that, Verizon reception in the kitchen and living room is poor but not bad in the bedroom. Not 100%. It's about 65% but I think that will do as it's working at that level here at J.'s. 

I'm feeling quite tired today. It's chilly. Elwood thought it was cold enough to move onto my bed. Not a plan. I showed him his mat, closed the window a good deal and found him laying against the quilt, but on the floor, subsequently. He may be a candidate for a dog bed. I'll have to look into this.

Still waiting on the movers. 

I'm excited about how great the apartment looks. I hope I continue the bright an airy feel of it. </p></body></html>
