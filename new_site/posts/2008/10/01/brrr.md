Went off to church for dinner, discussion and Bible study. Still getting to know people. They are patient with me and work hard to identify themselves which is very nice. Elwood was very restless. He doesn't like a cold floor on which to lay down and Bible study ran long. He wanted to go home. 

We will have a time for Taize worship Sunday morning. I will try it out. It means not going to the book discussion, but it's only the first Sunday of the next 3 months. We will be reading The hHeart of Christianity by Marcus Borg. Fortunately, it is a Talking Book  download so it will be easy to access. 

I learned today my local hardware store gives a 10% discount to locals. And they're finished working on the street. I don't know yet if they've repaired the areas they dug up.</p></body></html>
