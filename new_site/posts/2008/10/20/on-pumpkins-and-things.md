<html><body><p>On Friday I was able to go to an apple orchard which had many varieties of airloom apples. I bought some Harolds and Prairie Spy. I wondered if Prairie Spy are related to Northern Spy, but the woman didn't know. We talked about how people from new jersey long for Stamin Winesap apples but no one outside of new Jersey has ever heard of them. I also bought a pumpkin with a very nice stem to sit on the table.

On the way home, I felt a sore throat coming on and I'm down with a cold. Quite nasty. I haven't had a cold in a long time. I think Wisconsin germs got to me before i could develop some resistance against them.

I rested and stayed home from church as well. Today has been busy. I worked with a mobility person in the morning. I discovered I was working with incorrect information on the library and that is why I didn't turn at the right place. Now that is sorted out. The area is doing a lot for people in Spanish and trying to get folks up and running. Everyone was very pleasant at the library and the MATC extension. That is where they are teaching in English, in spanish and in both to give people skills.

Later, cousin Tom came with friends to work on the router. Success! I now can connect wirelessly and I'm all incripted.

I had a wonderful plate of tomato soup at the coffee shop and an egg sandwich for dinner. My shopping list for tomorrow's delivery has honey for my tea, lozengers with zinc,, throat soothing tea and some cans of tomato soup. The coop doesn't carry familiar brands so I'm
experimenting with Amy's Kitchen and finding low fat and low salt items. Not alll of Amy's are like this. I bought a larger container of milk, too. I've been a bit hampered by not having some ready made items on hand. Amy's Kitchen lists its nutritional info and ingredients on-line so it is a good brand to use.

Mother suggested gargling with salt. I had forgotten about that and it really helped. I stopped off at Walgreen's and bought some "walfed". It sounds bad but I think it is helping.</p></body></html>
