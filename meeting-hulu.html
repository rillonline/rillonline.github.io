<p>
We met Hulu today.  Nina and I got off the bus and went to the car. Hulu was waiting in the passenger footwell. Nina got into the back. Immediately Nina and Hulu met each other over the console. It took Sara and I a little bit to get both girls settled in their respective places.
</p>

<p>
We drove to the coffee shop. Although the temps were in the 50s, we sat outside by the fire pit. It was too noisy inside. The dogs behaved themselves though Hulu needed a lot of encouragement to be still. She is still learning.
</p>

<p>
When we went back to the house, the dogs had fun playing. Lots of roughhousing.
</p>

<p>
We will visit again soon.
