<p>This morning the local students left. They are driven home by an instructor who does some work with them around home. We had to say good-bye to one of our classmates. Our class list has names and addresses but not phone numbers. I asked if she could take down my number. She said her equipment was packed. Then I had an idea--I went to the map room where there is a braille machine and wrote down my numbers.
</p>
<p>This morning we went to the hospital. Elwood was indifferent to the hospital personnel and equipment he saw. Our greatest excitement was the electronic revolving door.
</p>
<p>I am mostly packed. What is left I am still using.
</p>
<p>It's raining and I'm wearing my crocks which means the rain can come through the holes. My sneakers are almost dry, sitting on the window sill.
</p>
<p>This afternoon we will take the bus.
</p>
<p>This brings me to going home. Here are some things to remember.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Elwood is a new, young dog. Caitlin was older and seasoned.</li>
<li>Do not compare these dogs. They are both labs but the similarity ends there.</li>
<li>Elwood will make mistakes. He has never been in Jamestown or any place else I've been already.</li>
<li>
<strong>Do not pet the dog!</strong> Elwood and I need to develop good working habits. What we do in this first month will be with us forever!</li>
<li>I will be tied to Elwood for at least two weeks. No one else can take him anywhere. We willl be establishing our patterns and his park schedule.</li>
<li>Elwood has a lot to live up to and some specific skills to develop. We will be spending a lot of time working on his behavior at home and away. For example, Elwood will learn  how to lay quietly unsupervised during the anointing and sharing of the peace at the Thursday morning healing service. He doesn't know how to do this now but he can sit in his place and wait for his dinner to arrive. it's amazing.</li>
<li>Although you are all special people, I am the only one special to Elwood for the next 6-12 months. That's how long it will take to adjust to one another.</li>
<li>Remember, Elwood has not lived in a household situation since May. He will have to relearn this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Elwood was very curious this morning. I packed his mut mat in my suitcase. I think that caused more sniffing than the 8-pound bag of food.</p>
