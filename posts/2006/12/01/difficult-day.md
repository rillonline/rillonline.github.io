<html><body><p>A difficult day today. It was rainy in the morning and it was warm. Came back drenched--Elwood, too. I was paired up with one student in the A.M. and paired up with a different student this afternoon. It was so dark and the sidewalks were crowded  by 3 p.m. 
</p><p>Elwood worked well avoiding most obstacles and being careful in tight places, however, he wasn't pulling. I'm working with the instructor and the class supervisor. We'll see how Elwood does tomorrow at our <q>test</q> and at the beginning of the week with a day and a half of rest. It's worrisome. Pray for restorative rest and good work habits.</p></body></html>
