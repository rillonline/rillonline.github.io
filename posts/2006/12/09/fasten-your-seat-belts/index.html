<p>Yesterday we had a <q>Meet and Greet</q> exercise whereby some of the instructors came up to shake my hand and Elwood had to remain sitting.
</p>
<p><q>Is this a wedding with the mother of the bride?</q> one of the instructors asked.
</p>
<p><q>Sunday morning worship,</q> I replied.
</p>
<p>He came, sobbing, saying <q>A wonderful sermon.</q>
</p>
<p>He greeted another student, thanking her for such a lovely wedding, then he came back to me, shaking my hand, telling me what a wonderful sermon for the funeral. The task was serious, the play acting hysterically funny.
</p>
<p>We shopped at a pet store and went to Wall-Mart for our afternoon outing. One of the dogs jumped up on the counter when his person was checking out.
  </p>
<p>This morning we did some country-style work in a subdivision--walking along people's front yards, around parked cars, onto short pieces of sidewalk, lining myself up to cross a street.
</p>
<p>Afterwards, we went to an A&amp;P to practice shopping cart work. We've been doing it right, shoppers, guide in front of the basket, person and dog behind. Elwood left the bread and the meaqt alone.
</p>
<p>Clerks crack me up. They are giving you instructions with the debit card because you're blind and then keep saying, <q>Now press the green button.</q>
</p>
<p>I was able to get my wash done--not a lot to do because of the early instances of emergency washes.
</p>
<p>Lunch was a cafateria line with a tray and silverware wrapped in napkins. Our sandwiches and dessert were wrapped in foil, our macaroni salad in a cup with a lid and our soup in a double coffee cup with a lid. Then we worked our dogs to our tables while carrying the tray against our bodies. I said to our server, who also does housekeeping, <q>You must hate it--all this trash to pick up.</q> She replied, <q>I don't hate. I can handle it once a month.</q> Drinks were served at the table.
</p>
<p>This afternoon we practiced in the airline
 seats provided by Continental. These were first class seats though with lots of room for dogs, even in the bulk heads. 
</p>
<p>We read our puppy profiles. Elwood was raised by a veteran puppy raiser--an older couple with grandchildren who came to visit. Some reports have lots of information. Sadly, neither of my puppy reports have been too detailed. My instructor said the training report she gets was not particularly detailed either.
</p>
<p>We changed tables again at supper for the rest of the time here. I don't handle this well. This table will take some getting used to. I tire of the cross examinations. Just let me be!
</p>
<p>This evening we learned how to massage our dogs. Elwood wasn't sure about this at first. He mellowed over time. We listened to this album: <a href="http://www.napster.com/player/tracks/14164011" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.napster.com/images/buttons/btn_play.gif" border="0">A Gathering
