I keep flirting with restructured text because there are some cool things Nikola can do with it. It's a disaster. I can't get a handle on the emacs shortcut keys and there's a lot of processing which I find rather visual. As a result, I will stick to markdown, getting better at it, I hope, and learn to use relative links more efficiently.
