On Saturday my son put the case together for my B+ raspberry pi. It came in six pieces. The first thing he did was remove the backing paper. Then it was obvious the six pieces are acryllic. The case looks lovely. I am so pleased. The top even comes off if I need to access the pi directly. Here's [the link](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pi-box-plus/assembling-the-case) to the instructions.
