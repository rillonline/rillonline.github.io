Hulu has discovered the fun of splashing the water in the community water bowl with her front paws. It causes much human excitement and a tsunami in the dining room. The men at the prison are going to have to break her of this habit. You can't tell a guide dog user "Your new dog will flood the area where you put her bowl."

Nina is unsure about water. This summer we introduced her to a wading pool. She will jump into it, bite the water, but she is not keen on sitting down and refuses to lay in the water.

To be sure, she is a messy drinker. I have her bowl on a tray with a towel underneath the bowls. I have to change the towel frequently as it gets saturated.
