I write to please myself and if I can inspire, help or make you laugh, that pleases me.

On these pages, you will find a range of material:

+ autobiographical pieces
+ essays
+ poetry
+ fiction, mostly fantasy/science fiction
+ technical info especially directed toward the visually impaired user
+ sermons and other spiritual writing

I have worked as a programmer and as a Christian minister. I have been blind since an early age. Currently. I am now retired.
