<p>I sat down today with Paul and later Jason to discuss my texts for January 27th. I primarily wanted to talk to Paul about Nehemiah 8 and if my analysis of the text was consistent with his understanding of Nehemiah and its place in the history of Israel. Paul is a thoughtful student and teacher so I learned a great deal.</p>
<p>When Jason joined us after his meeting, I explored the practicalities of preaching at St. Luke's. Jason's sermons are about 7 minutes long. I'm used to having more time to develop my sermon so cutting back to between 700 and 1000 words will be challenging. I am starting to think of this as my flash sermon as flash fiction stories are no longer than a thousand words.</p>
<p>Here's a basic summary of what we worked out today:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Over 7 days, the people (which includes women and children as well as men) here the Torah read aloud. There are break out groups where the Levites translate and instruct small groups of the people.</p></li>
<li><p>It would appear that Ezra reads more than a law code but reads a great deal of the Torah. If you postulate he read for 3 hours and a person reads 30 pages an hour and he read for 7 days, that works out to 630 pages.</p></li>
<li><p>A further postulation is that Ezra started with Genesis and read through the Torah so that the people heard the entire story of God's saving work including fetching the people bak from Egypt and entering the promised land.</p></li>
<li><p>The people are in mourning but they are told to rejoice. This is a happy story because it is the account of God's faithfulness to the people, the story of his mighty acts to save.</p></li>
<li><p>Nehemiah prays at the opening of the book that God continues to be faithful so that the people may not be scattered  again.</p></li>
<li><p>St. Paul speaks to the Corinthians about being the body of Christ, being one body. Each person is important in their own right. The Corinthians wanted to compete with one another to have the best gifts but Paul tells them that each person in the  congregation  is equally important.</p></li>
<li><p>Jesus widens the idea of the congregation to include the captive and the disabled. All are welcome and all have gifts to share.</p></li>
<li><p>This is a joyful task. The body grows. No one need be afraid.</p></li>
<li><p>Witth 23% of Americans identifying as atheist or of no religion, there are lots of people to extend an invitation to. Our message is one of joy, that God's mighty acts continue and that our worship and community is joyful. We are not here to condemn and to mourn our shortcomings.</p></li>
<li><p>We are sent out with gladness and singleness of heart to share this joy with everyone we meet.</p></li>
</ol>
