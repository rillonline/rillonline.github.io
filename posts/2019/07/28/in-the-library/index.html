Picture this. Ronnie, our intrepid heroine, is
sitting in the great library of the wizards in the heart of Magic
City. (I know. I know. These names are not very imaginative and need
changing, but it is the best I can do right now.) Anyway, she is
sitting in the library not because she wants to be there but because
she is compelled to be there. The Tribunal of All Wizards (Is this a
better name?) has sentenced her to serve there for some unspecified
length of time. She goes to the library at the pleasure of the Grand
Mistress of Wizards who doesn't like her to begin with. Ronnie is
fulfilling her sentence for the misuse of magic which caused the death
of her mentor, Grand Master Awk.
</p>

<p>
Although Ronnie is unhappy that she must remain in the Magic Lands for
perhaps the rest of her life, she makes the best of being confined to
the library and her living quarters for most of every day. As
imprisonments go in the inhabited galaxy, it is a very lenient
sentence.
</p>

<p>
The wizards did not come up with this punishment without
reason. Ronnie has shown an aptitude for magic. The wizards hope she
can learn to read and understand the books stored in the library which
they cannot even open. Ronnie thinks their hope in her is
misplaced. Even if she can open a book, why do they think she can read
an ancient script and make sense of it. She does not possess these
skills.
</p>

<p>
Neverthe less, she goes to the library and tries to open every book on
every shelf. There are many thousands of books.
</p>

<p>
Then one day Ronnie lugs a very large volume to the library table by
the window. It has a pleasant view of a garden. She sets the tome
down. What else can she possibly call the book but a tome. It is
dusty. Its binding shows much wear. She wonders just how old this book
is and what sort of a book this is. There are no pictures on the
covers. The script on its binding is beautiful and perhaps contains
grains of precious gems. This is not her expertise either but the
script seems to sparkle.
</p>

<p>
With no expectations at all, she tries to open the book. And it
opens.
</p>

<p>
Ronnie gasps. The librarian, working at his desk across the room,
looks up to see the book open and hurries over.
</p>

<p>
"Can you read it?" he asks rather breathlessly.
</p>

<p>
"Can you see the pictures?" Ronnie asks him.
</p>

<p>
"The page is blank," the librarian responds, puzzled.
</p>

<p>
"No, it is not," Ronnie says. "It is a beautifully done star chart."
</p>

<p>
They stand in silence. Ronnie can see it while the librarian cannot.
</p>

<p>
"A star chart of what?" the librarian finally asks.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," Ronnie says. "I would need a modern star chart and a
way to evaluate procession and drift. I don't recognize any of these
stars, but I am not from around this part of the galactic arm. The
constellations look all wrong to me."
</p>

<p>
"Can you copy the chart?" the librarian asks quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Let's see if I can," Ronnie says.
</p>

<p>
Then she smiles. "If this is a map to treasure, I claim it by virtue
of being able to read the map."
</p>

<p>
The librarian does not see the humor in her claim but hurries away to
get paper and writing implements. He also calls the Grand Mistress and
she comes to hover over Ronnie's shoulder.
</p>

<p>
After Ronnie's crude representation of the beautiful chart and much
discussion, the Tribunal corrects the star chart for this time
period. They show it to Ronnie.
</p>

<p>
"It's Planet X," she says, pointing to a particular
constellation. I've been there."
</p>

<p>
In an earlier unpublished adventure, she and Captain Star Runner visited this
forbidden planet with disastrous results.
