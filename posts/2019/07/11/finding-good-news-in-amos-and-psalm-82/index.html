These are the Hebrew Scripture readings for July 14, 2019 in the
United Methodist Church.
</p>

<p>
I am not preaching, but a friend asked me to find good news in Amos
7:1-17 (the whole chapter). Here's what is going on:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Things are going well in Israel. The economy is humming
along. Business is good. There are no imminent threats.</li>
<li>Israel has set up a variant of worship within its borders, not
supporting, going to or wanting to worship in Jerusalem in the
kingdom of Judah.</li>
<li>Despite the good economy and the absence of threats foreign or
domestic, the poor are suffering. Trickle down economics didn't work
then either and many of them are being cheated when they buy goods.</li>
<li>God sends Amos, whose name means <i>burden-bbearer</i> to prophesy.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Amos is from Judah.</li>
<li>Amos is not a professional prophet. He has not attended prophet
school. (Yes, they had them back then.)</li>
<li>Amos seems himself as a shepherd and a sycamore tree farmer.</li>
<li>The Common English Bible (2010) agrees with my Old Testament
professor who insisted that Amos speaks about himself in the
present tense. He still tends sheep and fruit trees.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The word is bad for Israel and particularly Amaniah in this chapter,
but the good news is directed to God's championing the poor. Things
are out of alignment in Israel. That is why God shows Amos the plumb
line. Measure Israel. See how askew it is. It needs to be brought back
to plumb, to act, as Micah puts it, like this: "… to do justly, to love mercy,
and to walk humbly with your God" Micah 6:8b NKJV).
</p>

<p>
Amos bears the burden of speaking God's word in a foreign country to
hostile audiences. He does it because he is obedient to God's call and
because the people of Israel are God's people, too.
</p>

<p>
Psalm 82 is subtitled, in my New King James Version of the Bible, <i>An
Appeal to Justice</i>. When we cannot bring things into plumb, we ask God
to do it. We are confident that God will do it even if it is not on
our time table.
</p>

<p>
The psalmist says"All the foundations of the earth are unstable"
(Psalm 82:5c NKJV).
</p>

<p>
In the Gospel for Sunday, Jesus shows how the good Samaritan behaves
towards the helpless man and
declares that he has fulfilled the law to love his neighbor as
himself. The Samaritan was able to do this:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Tend the injured man's wounds</li>
<li>Bring him to the inn</li>
<li>Engage the innkeeper to continue to care for the injured man</li>
<li>Promised to reimburse the innkeeper for any expense above what the
Samaritan had already paid.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Sometimes the fix is beyond our individual or collective ability. Then
we appeal to God for the justice we are unable to deliver.
</p>

<p>
This is not an excuse. It is a reality.
</p>

<p>
Anaziah and Jeroboam were powerful men.  As such, God  charged them to
care for the poor and needy.
</p>

<p>
God's charge has not changed. Providing safe and sanitary conditions
for migrants at our southern border is not a political matter. God has
charged us to care for those who are in need and for the sojourner
among us. It is a question of carrying out the will of God–Thy will
be done.
