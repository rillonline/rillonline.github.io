I was going to participate in [[campnanowrimo][Camp Nanowrimo]] this year. I like bbbsetting a low writing goal and meeting it. Call it childish if you like, but positive reinforcement is fun.

But I wanted to do something more than just write a first draft and so I was leery of making a commitment I couldn't keep. Again, seeing a congratulatory message on my screen is quite satisfying.

Here's what I really want to do:

- Edit my Kearsarge novel. I wrote it as part of [[nanowrimo][Nanowrimo]] some time ago and have never finished an edit. I would like to be able to give it to an editor and create an ebook out of it with a cover and everything.
- Publish Kearsarge to my [[rillonline][Github]] site with each chapter as a separate web page linked together. (Right now, I don't know how to do this. I am refreshing my knowledge of orgmode and learning new features.)
- Finish writing my memoir piece on Chance so that Cindy can look it over before I send it off to Joy.

I have already set up [[nikola][Nikola]] to deploy my blog and associated pages to [[github][Github]].
