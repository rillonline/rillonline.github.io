decided to let the good old Internet help me out.

It turns out that my friend Flyspell uses tab completion for
completing words. I don't want to turn off Flyspell since you would
end up reading articles with many misspellings.

The suggestion I found was to use m-tab for completions However,
alt+tab only switched me to another window. Enter the escape key!

escape=tab does the trick. =#+BEGIN_Q= becomes =#+BEGIN_QUOTE= after
pressing escape-tab. Take that Apple. I can't do that on a Mac with a
touch bar. Fortunately, I am not using one for this Linux installation.
