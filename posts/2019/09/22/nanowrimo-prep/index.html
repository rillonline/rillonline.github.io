<a href="https://www.nanowrimo.org">Nanowrimo</a> doesn't start until November 1, but an email dropped into my
inbox about Nanowrimo prep. I started reading over the
<a href="https://preview.nanowrimo.org/nano-prep-101">material</a> I began to sketch out my novel.
</p>

<p>
I realized I needed more information so I started reading Blake
Snyder's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49464.Save_the_Cat">Save the Cat: The Last Book on Screenwriting You'll Ever Need</a>. Yes, I know, it's about screenwriting but it is applicable to
novel writing, too. I also consulted Jessica Brody's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/32805475-save-the-cat-writes-a-novel"> Save the Cat!
Writes a Novel</a>.
</p>

<p>
I realized very quickly I did not have enough information to plot my
novel. I know the beginning and the ending, but I had no idea what
happens in the middle. And the middle is 60% of the novel. The ending
is clear, but not how the middle ends and how the ending begins.
</p>

<p>
Instead I realized I needed to go back to a project I started putting
together in 2015. I call this novel the Three Laws of Magic. I am
focusing on only one law of magic here: With great power comes great
responsibility. This will be familiar to those of you who use <code>sudo</code>
on your Linux machines. I am still not sure if the other admonishments
work here or not.
</p>

<p>
The novel I have set aside is clearly the third book in the series and
perhaps my experiments with <i>The Wizard of Marling</i> is the second
book.
</p>

<p>
Here's how I know <i>Mulberry Bend</i> is the third novel.
</p>

<p>
In Brody's book, she lists ten universal lessons:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Forgiveness: of self or of others</li>
<li>Love: includes self-love, family love, romantic love</li>
<li>Acceptance: of self, of circumstances, of reality</li>
<li>Faith: in oneself, in others, in the world, in God</li>
<li>Fear: overcoming it, conquering it, finding courage</li>
<li>Trust: in oneself, in others, in the unknown</li>
<li>Survival: including the will to live</li>
<li>Selflessness: including sacrifice, altruism, heroism, and overcoming greed</li>
<li>Responsibility: including duty, standing up for a cause, accepting one’s destiny</li>
<li>Redemption: including atonement, accepting blame, remorse, and salvation</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>
I know <i>Mulberry Bend</i> is acceptance. I tried putting this with <i>The
Three Laws of Magic</i> and I realized my protagonist doesn't accept who
she is at the end. So I looked through the list and came to the
conclusion that her growth point is responsibility. This is not as
great a leap for Ronnie Camberwell as acceptance will be. As I said, I
have no idea what book two will require.
</p>

<p>
Having spent time with the 15 "beats" of <i>Save the Cat</i>, I decided
this structure didn't fit my novel as well as my original structure as
laid out by Christopher Bogler in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/173302.The_Writer_s_Journey"> The Writer's Journey: Mythic
Structure for Writers</a>. 
</p>

<p>
All of these books are based on Joseph Campbell's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/588138.The_Hero_With_a_Thousand_Faces"> The Hero With a Thousand Faces</a> which he published in 1949. Campbell posits that all stories from
all around the world have the same structure regardless of their
genre. As listeners, readers or watchers of story, we find this
structure satisfying.
</p>

<p>
I've never been a plotter, but since I have had trouble writing this
novel in a general sort of way, I decided to try structure this time.
Stay tuned. There will be more as I proceed.
