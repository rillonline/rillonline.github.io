I have started to write a book which gathers together some of my
previous posts on Org and then fleshes out the material.

I first set up a to-do to track my progress. I am modifying the steps
as I go, but here is what it currently looks like:

 #+begin_example
 * STARTED Write a series of articles on getting organized with org mode [5/10]

     1. [X] Gather all files into a new git repository
     2. [X] Create a landing page for the ebook
     3. [X] Write an outline for my getting organized articles
     4. [X] Integrate blog posts into this outline
     5. [X] Write a script to convert .org files to .md files and copy
        them to the book directory
     6. [ ] Write the book. Chapter by Chapter goes below.
     7. [ ] Publish the ebook
     8. [ ] Upload the ebook to archive.org
     9. [ ] Update the download link on the landing page.
     10. [ ] Write a blog post announcing the book.
#+end_example

I have checked off have of the items, but it is the easy stuff I've
checked off. So far I only have listed one items for writing the book
though I plan on adding check boxes underneath this item so I can
check off each chapter. The final check box is to review the entire
book and make any necessary corrections.

"STARTED" is a to-do state that I developed for my projects. More on
that when I discuss "TODO" in general.

- Setting up the git repository was very straight forward on [[https://github.com/][github]].
  Then I looked over my blog and copied the posts that applied into
  that directory and updated the repository.
- I then wrote a landing page for the book. The idea of a landing page
  is to have the potential reader focus on your book and the *Call to
  Action* which is for you, the reader, to click on the "buy" button.
  My page is quite simple and does not have a "Download" button yet
  since the book is not finished. You can look at it [[https://rillonline.github.io/living-my-life-in-plain-text-page.html][her
