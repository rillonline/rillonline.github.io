<html><body><p>Elwood's ideas about reading and blogging at riverside are very different from my ideas. He got tangled and I wanted to be sure he was present and not off somewhere else so I added the flxi lead to the mix. Elwood was thrilled. He came right over, got between my legs, curled up and settled in It made moving or using the bluetooth keyboard impossible because every time he settled his chin on one leg and I moved the keyboard to the other leg, he had to move and use the keyboard leg. There was to be no competition for my body parts.

So I read something else. Then we got up and sort of left, but I realized no one was at the picnic table so we went in search of it and eventually found it. I tried several tying options. Togetherness is Elwood's priority. Fortunately, laying down on the bench was not one of his ideas--at least this time. I was able to work some. I will have to bring some towels so if I need to sit on the grass, it will be more comfortable. Maybe I will even get to stretch out though Elwood might think this was an invitation to cuddle up.</p></body></html>
