<html><body><p>Elwood wants to take a walk but today hasn't been a good day for a walk. The temp is fine. I've just had things to do.

We went to the Farmer's MArket. Elwood sniffed, went under the tables to see what is stored there and ate a flower.

Elwood came home, and after having his flea stuff was aplied, went and curled up on the day bed. He's near the same color as the day bed but he has brown eyes and the comforter on thebed does not so someone saw him there. 

And through it all he kept climbing up to tell me he is having a hard day. What kind of day does he think I am having?</p></body></html>
