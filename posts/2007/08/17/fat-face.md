<html><body><p>Gail mentioned Elwood looked as if he had filled out and was older looking. Elwood has gained some weight. It seems he has gained weight in his face. He is broader around the eyes making his head appear wider. Talk about having a fat face or a fat head!

Earlier today I went to the farmer's market and brought home some small green peppers, wonderfully unique in their conformation: no two alike. One rolled out of the bag onto the floor. Elwood thought it was his. Fortunately, someone else realized the problem and took it away from him but not before he has made it unusable for human consumption. I was worried that he would eat the inside of the pepper and become ill.

He also confiscated the husked ear of corn that rolled off the counter. I yelled and retrieved it. There are limits to my patience on these matters.</p></body></html>
