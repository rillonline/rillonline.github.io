<p>Today has been a glorious day. It was cool. We went for a long walk and Elwood got through the trouble spots just fine. I lost track of streets and when he wanted to turn down one I said okay knowing that I could probably figure out where the stop sign was where we cross. Less trucks especially on the bridge. Some people out. At one point we met some people we know who were putting grass seed in front of the building.</p>
<p>Working with a dog is a partnership. One of the balancing acts is initiative and expectation. Elwood needs to evaluate a situation and make a call: are the branches going to interfere with us walking on the sidewalk and should he walk on the grass? Is it safe to go after I give the command? Where is the up curb on the other side of the road? On the other hand, too much initiative can get us off our route. Let's go here. Let's not go the way we always go.</p>
<p>I was walking out the 4th Street door of the church the other day. Someone said, "Have a great walk home. It's not raining and looks like it will be a nice day." "I guess I'm going this way," I said, indicating Elwood. He was pointingdown the stret to Spring Street. That's the long way home. He didn't want to go back the way we had come, the short way. I could have turned him around. But I had time and I knew we probably wouldn't get any other walk in that day so we went down to Pendergast STreet to get a few extra blocks in. It didn't matter to me right then. At other times, it does matter which way we go so we go there.</p>
<p>IK went to church this evening. Friends sat behind me. When we came back from Communion, Elwood was wagging his tail all excited. I go him into the pew and before I could get him down, he stepped up onto the pew to chat with the friends at the next pew.</p>
<p>"I didn't do anything," my friend protested.</p>
<p>"I knowk," I said, holding my head. "If you had, he would have bounded over the back of the pew into your lap."</p>
