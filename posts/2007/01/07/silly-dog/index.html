<p>Today Elwood was quite funny.
</p>
<ol>
<li>When we got into the car to go to church, Elwood tried sitting on my lap. He has done this more since he got his tail caught in the door. After I convinced him to get into the foot well, he positioned his nose under the dash and left his harness in my lap--opposite of what is usually done.</li>
<li>During the sermon, Elwood fell asleep. Good. Well, not so good. He started dreaming. His feet were going. His whole body was shaking. He began yipping. He started barking and there wasn't any correction I could give him. He was asleep. I thought about waking him up, but that really didn't seem fair. The pastor said afterward: <q>Not only do I put people to sleep. Now I put dogs to sleep, too.</q>
</li>
<li>Elwood has a rubbery toy called a cong. It's wider at the bottom than at the top with rings getting smaller and smaller. Both ends are open. Sometimes he carries it in his mouth. Tonight he began racing around, running up and down the hall. Whoever created the sounds in cartoons of animals running and then screeching to a stop knew a dog like el wood. That's exactly what it sounds like. He also began making noises through the cong. It sounded like a hooting noise. I was laughing so hard I couldn't get his harness on. I had him give me the cong, put it on the bookcase, he took it back and the running and noisemaking started all over again. He knew I would just laugh. Finally I said to him, <q>We have to get serious,</q> and we did.</li>
