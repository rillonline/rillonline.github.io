<html><body><p>It is very cool here today, very much like fall. I had time to take a walk. I had to wear socks to keep my toes warm. We went down the hill to the river walk then along Harrison and back up the hill. 

Along the way, Elwood needed to make a stop. I had a bag and had to stick it in my pocket. I don't think very hard on this, but I keep the end sticking out of my pocket. It makes it easier when I find the trash. I also entertain the idea that someone will grab the end of the bag and snatch it away from me and then, well, they get what they deserve.

I used the talking compass. It's direction depends a great deal on how I hold it. I've decided it's greatest use when out and about and I know where I'm at is positioning myself at a rounded curb. The river walk was interesting because we seemd    to be traveling northeast, then east, then southeast and finally south when we got to Harrison, then traveled southwest to Main and northeast up the hill. This all could be the way I held the compass, but I'm getting fairly consistent. Unfortunately, the compass only has 12 points so I don't have north northwest and south by southwest and all those other points ... eggs and ham.</p></body></html>
