I have been feeling very lathargic lately. I think there are several
things going on here:

1. I've been dealing with a cranky tooth.
2. I've been working on my poetry.
3. The weather has been hot.
4. I've been doing more cooking than I have in years. This
   basically means that I'm cooking dinner rather than
   heating up something already prepared.

Except for the poetry, everything else sounds pretty lame.

The poetry I have been writing and will read at our first poetry
reading at the senior center is quite personal and revealing. That is
the way good poetry is. I need to accept that. However, it is
exhausting to write and to read over and make corrections. My next
challenge is to create Braille copies of everything.
