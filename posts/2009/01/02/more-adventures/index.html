<p>Not to be daunted, we went out again today and went to the Post Office. This is a very confusing place. It was a former A&amp;P from what I understand. Lots of stations, people, and automatic doors. One difficulty is getting outside again. You have to go to the out for the door to open. Dogs expect to go out the door they came in.</p>
<p>It was leaving the Post office that proved to be a challenge for Elwood--or more to the point, getting back on the sidewalk. He made a grand tour of the parking lot and we had a nice chat with a man from Australia from his accent back at the Post office. Eventually, we got back on track and went off to the library to return a book and pick up another book. We has some miscommunication about what a clear sidewalk is and about ice and not going into the street. I tend to be unreasonable if I think there is a possibility about going out into the street and Elwood maintains that icy sidewalks are not what he considers suitable for walking. I try to make up for my dis stress by congratulating him on all good work just as enthusiastically as I fussed about staying on the sidewalk. There is one area he likes to tramp through the snow coming back. I don't know what he is avoiding. I of course sink down further in the snow than he does.</p>
<p>Then the fun began. We crossed the street. The angle was a little strange. I wanted to go a particular direction. I think he did not. The GPS advised we were going in a direction I did not want to go and I figured Elwood did want to go. I turned around and we wandered. Eventually, I figured out we had recrossed the street and may have been walking on the bike path. Then again, we may have been walking on the side of the street. I will give Elwood the benefit of the doubt here though we did not cross a snow bank to get across the street eventually. The cool part was that the GPS could tell me how far I was from our corner. I kept pressing the button and eventually we were approaching it. I suggested right and Elwood turned appropriately. The challenge then became crossing safely. It was windy. I had on a hood. I knew we were in the right place not only because of the GPS but by a car which turned. I'm sure Elwood knew exactly where the crosswalk was. Some cars passed and then it was our turn. Zip. And zip all the way home. Elwood was glad to get back.</p>
<p>I did not mention in a previous post that we also managed to get locked out New Year's Day. I buzzed a neighbor. I didn't realize I was on the wrong row of buttons and buzzed someone on the other side of the building. She was nice enough not only to let me in but to step outside her door to see if I had indeed come inside.</p>
