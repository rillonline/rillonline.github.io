<html><body><p>Elwood arrived on my lap to say it was almost 8 o'clock. Time to go out. So we did.

It has been snowing. Not much you understand. I was wearing my crocs, of course, klogs, lined but still the holes on top can take in snow and there's not a whole lot of insolation.

Well, Elwood did his thing and then decided to sniff. New snow. Much snuffling sounds. Where is the stoop?

Now, to be fair, Elwood probably did show it to me and I wandered away, but it was not clear because of the new snow. We started moving up and down the driveway, me in my crocs and Elwood happily snuffling away with much volume and enthusiasm. I finally found that I was in the right place thru Elwood's half-hearted direction and the light over the door.

Now, I need to say that as we were going out into the hallway, Elwood was very insistant that we go out while he held a bone in his mouth. The bone ended up in the hallway outside the apartment as we dashed to the outside door.

Upon our return inside, I directed Elwood to find his bone. He dashed away, jerking the leash out of my hand and gobbled up his bone. We went inside. I took the leash off. Where is the bone? Bone? I can't find it! I opened the door. Where's your bone. Here it is. Back inside, please. Both Elwood and bone are now safely inside.

I spend a lot of energy and so do others keep track of Elwood's bones.
