<p>Today is a school holiday. My friends, their niece and their cousin's wife came to make cheese. We made two kinds of cheese, mozzarella and lemon cheese. It was quite exciting. We even had milk from a local dairy 20 miles north of Madison. We will visit one day as their is an artisan cheese maker nearby.</p>
<p>When the cheese making was done, we went to Ian's for pizza.Although Ian's can make you a pie, they typically sell by the slice and have 20 varieties to choose from. They are happy to run them down for you as you move around the display area. Combinations of vegetables, meats and fruit capped by their best-seller: macaroni and cheese pizza. This is a white pizza with elbow macaronis. I had a slice of this and a spinach-roasted pepper-and-portobella mushroom slice. This latter was a bit wet and I would choose something else another time. The cousin met us there for lunch.</p>
<p>Afterward we stopped by a popcorn store. Like the pizza joint, they sell all kinds of popcorn. Friends bought several kinds including a rainbow popcorn with raspberry, blueberry, grape, lime and vanilla popcorn mixed together. Reviews from the back seat varied.</p>
<p>We also went to St. Vinnie's where I found more containers for bulk items and some plates to match my table--a whole box-full for $12. </p>
<p>Another stop was at the coop for a few items I forgot and to check on the membership requirements as they are changing. I need to show some paperwork for a special membership. I will be able to do so next month after my hair cut downtown. </p>
<p>I brought the Trekker Breeze with me to mark more places of interest. K was able to wear it on her glove. This did not work for me. I tried attaching it to my sleeve with a little more success. The purpose has got to go. I can only manage two things and Elwood is one of them. <a href="//elwood/">Elwood</a>, for his part, enjoyed the attention but was very, very bouncy and so needed much correction. </p>
<p>I also had sighted assistance for a computer problem support and I are working together on.</p>
<p>It was a good day. Currently, two loads of wash are in the dryer.     </p>
