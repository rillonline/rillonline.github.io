<p>I'm proud to be Celtic today, but then I'm proud to be Celtic every day.</p>
<p>It was incredibly warm today. I wore a sweatshirt outside and was too hot.</p>
<p>We took a very long walk with panting and everything. We went to Regent Street via the Arbor item. Dogs and their people were everywhere and all the dogs misbehaved. I guess they are thinking it has been a long winter, too. </p>
<p>I thought I would see if I could find the dock, but I didn't and went on to Regent Street to see how the walk down South Randall turned out. L had driven it and said there was sidewalk all the way and there is. Along Vilas--I don't know exactly how I ended up on Vilas--there is a very steep hill so not a plan for winter months to walk there. </p>
<p>I went into this cafe where I had been previously. We ended up at the kitchen and the guys there acted very weird. I decided they lacked social skills. perhaps they were closed, but there door was open. They gave me a bottle of soda on the house and I thought I'd sit, drink the diet Coke and listen to my iPod. Well, being in an empty cafe is a really weird experience and I had the iPod upside down in the arm strap. By the time I took off my sweatshirt, fixed the iPod and drank a little soda, it was too weird to stay so we left. I almost thought I was locked in the place. The doors wouldn't push open. Eventually,, I found a release very low on the door and we left. It was beginning to feel very much like a horror movie.</p>
<p>Of course I had to walk around with a full poop bag in my pocket. I wonder if the guys at the restaurant could smell it and wondered what might be wrong with me. Unfortunately, I can't find garbage cans. On one corner I found some bins but decided they could easily be mailboxes and I didn't want to mail the stuff.</p>
<p>People were everywhere. Traffic rolls pretty slowly around town except for the major thoroughfares. We were out for about 2 hours, walking most of the time. Elwood actually thought he'd like to get home, get a drink and get some dinner.</p>
<p>It's supposed to cool down tomorrow and maybe rain or snow or something.</p>
<p>It was windy today, too. It would have been March nasty if it was colder. </p>
