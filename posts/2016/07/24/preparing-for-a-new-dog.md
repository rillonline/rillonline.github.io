<html><body><p>I have been putting off writing this article. for some time because preparing for a new dog is more than looking forward to a long-anticipated outing. Getting a new guide dog requires physical, mental and emotional preparation.</p>

<h2 id="thephysical">The Physical</h2>

<p>As a guide dog ages, it slows down, just like we do. Because their life span is shorter, the slow down is more noticeable. Consequently, I have been walking slower and slower for some time. Now that I am using a white cane, I am walking even more slowly.</p>

<p>To remedy this, I worked out on a treadmill twice a week. This is not intensive training, I know, but I hope it will get my body used to moving faster and I will be more ready to walk with a much younger dog in his or her prime.</p>

<p>I keep up with my Senior Center exercise class twice a week. I also go to yoga classes two evenings a week.</p>

<p>The treadmill work will not continue when I return home. It is too hard on my legs and feet and does not fill in for walking. The walking pace is quite artificial and does not represent the way I walk with my dog. The exercise and yoga classes will. continue. I am switching to three yoga classes and one exercise class. My plan is to add several long walks each week. We will have to learn new routes together to accomplish this.</p>

<p>I have changed my exercise program for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>The yoga classes are more intense for me. I think I am ready for this increase in activity.</li>
<li>The yoga classes are all in the same venue—a clean space where the dog will be in the same general place under the same conditions for each class. I am hopeful this will allow us to develop good habits which will last for our entire partnership.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="mentalandemotionalpreparation">Mental and Emotional Preparation</h2>

<p>I have lumped these two categories together although I know they can be quite different. I am not sure where one ends and the other begins for me in my preparation.</p>

<h2 id="startingtheprocess">Starting the Process</h2>

<p>The process of preparing for a new dog begins with the old dog. For a year or more I talked about getting a new dog. I was trying to talk myself into it. I made excuses: </p>

<ul>
<li>The floor was too hard for old bones.</li>
<li>With time, the dogs just get too smart.</li>
<li>I told myself my dog, Elwood, was still doing his job well–and he did up to the last.</li>
</ul>

<p>All this made it very difficult to sit down at the computer in January and start filling out the “paperwork”. The link “When partnerships end” on the website didn’t help. I wanted my partnership with Elwood to last forever.</p>

<h2 id="waiting">Waiting</h2>

<p>Elwood and I kept working together while I waited. I had a tentative class date. It passed. The time was upon me to say good-bye to Elwood and send him off with his new family on their all-summer vacation. I hope to and a half months away will solidify his affection for his new family–people he has known for two/thirds of his life–and be enough of a separation from me that seeing me again will not divide his loyalty. (Elwood is a very loyal dog.) He is also very, very clear about who puts food in his bowl.</p>

<p>Waiting for a class date to be confirmed is a very discouraging process. It is easy to place blame on others or to be convinced there is favoritism. I have no idea what has taken so long. I just can’t imagine the “right dog” is that hard to find or I am such a unique individual that the right dog is so hard to come by.</p>

<h2 id="gettingreadytotravel">Getting Ready to Travel</h2>

<p>Somewhere along the line, I stopped liking travel. Perhaps it was the number of moves I have made. I just want to stay where I am.</p>

<p>But I have realized I am limiting my travel so much that I am not doing the things I want to do. To this end, I have set myself some goals and I have already achieved one of them by using Uber.</p>

<p>Using a white cane, I learned my neighborhood in a different way. I hope it will help me become more independent and confident when I return with my new dog.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Although saying good-bye to a partner is excruciatingly painful, I am confident I have done as much preparation as I could to be able to start the adventure of a new and successful partnership.</p></body></html>
