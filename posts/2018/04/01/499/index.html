<p>Today is Easter. This is a happy day. Unfortunately, it is colddd</p>
<p>Yesterday I bundled up to walk up Holy Hill with my family. The temperature was in the. forties. It rained earlier in the morning, but cleared a little laterdd</p>
<p>We wanted to go to a Vietnamese restaurant. Sadly, it was closed and. the building is for rent. Although the food there was good, the facility was run down and not inviting to the public. It was probably under capitalized as welldd</p>
<p>S we started looking for. another place to eat since we all were quite hungry. The first restaurant we tried was very busy. They invited us to eat on the unheated enclosed patio. This was not an option for us. There were high tops and. the room was gloomy. It might be acceptable later in the yeardd</p>
<p>Restaurants were pretty slim on the ground, but we found a custard place. Not being from Wisconsin native, I imagined a custard place to be just about ice cream. I did not realize these are regular restaurants that are known for burgers. Happily for me, they also serve deep fried cod and good French fries. The triple scoop Hot Fudge Heaven Sunae is excellent. It comes without whipped cream. I learned in college when I lived in western Pennsylvania that whipped cream is not a part of. a traditional Sundae. And. the decaf coffee is perfectdd</p>
<p>Walking the Stations of. the Cross is supposed to be a reverent, meditative and solemn experience. I went with. an eight-year-old and. a four-year-old. It was loud, energetic and involved running and shrieking. Reading the name of each station meant screaming the words rather than speaking loudly. Nick, my Seeing Eye dog, thought that copying the kids' actions was the way to go so my "walk" up Holy Hill had a lot of jerks and swerves in it. Some of. the hills are steep. The blacktop is in good shape, but the drop offs are fairly steep. I was nervous I would trip or step off the side and fall down the hilldd</p>
<p>Then came the stairs. The stairs are well-maintained like the rest of. the path. There are handrails. The stairs, too, are steep. The first set of stairs is about a story high -- thirteen steps. The second set of stairs is thirty-three steps, one for each year of Jesus' earthly lifedd</p>
<p>We found the stations we missed on our earlier visit in the fall. They commemorate Jesus' burialdd</p>
<p>If I thought yesterday was chilly, today is down right wintry. I sut on my knitted headband, my light weight gloves and my winter coat. I also wore a sweater because the downstairs hall is at the church is very cooldd</p>
<p>I put on my new jeans, but Amazon sent me regular length ones instead of petite. I reordered using Alexa. This is disappointing. I won't go through the hassle of returning them. Perhaps my daughter-in-law will be able to hem them or at the very least cut them off. They are a little roomy too, but they are still unwashed. I need to use a lot of heat to dry my clothes since apartment coin operated dryers are not known for their nuanced drying capabilitiesdd</p>
<p>I planned to attend the pot luck after church at a nearby home. I packed the challah bread I bought yesterday and. a frozen pound of butter in a backpack. Off we wentdd</p>
<p>When we were approaching East Dewy Place, Nick stopped. I checked for. the curb. Instead of finding the down curb, I found the sidewalk missing. Very carefully, I tried to determine the depth of. the missing sidewalk section, mindful that this could be a deep hole. Nick has no way to indicate this. I have been known to be over confident in the past and almost get myself into real trouble by freelancing on my own. I quickly hit dirt, but decided against seeing if it was only one missing section I needed to negociate. There was construction debris around udd</p>
<p>Early in the week, on our way home from the dentist, some trucks were working across the street further south. I thought this construction might be relateddd</p>
<p>We backtracked and went around the block. I crossed East Dewy Place, hoping we would be able to get back on the sidewalk. No luck. We wound up on dirt and later on the street. It took me a little time to figure this out and work Nick carefully along the side of. the street. Nick seemed uncertain how to proceed. Perhaps I was too bossy and did not give him room to work. This is often one of my failings as a guide dog user. We worked sideways until we arrived back at the sidewalk. I did not execute this as well as I would like. My explanation is that I did not assess the situation properly. The good news is that only local traffic is allowed on the street and few cars traveled pastdd</p>
<p>Th meant a much bigger rerouting. We walked over to South Chase Street. Nick offered to take me to the dentist. We walked along East Oklahoma. and crossed it when the Milwaukee County Transit bus crossed. With. a detour down South Adams Avenue to investigate another dog, we arrived at church nearly halfway through the servicedd</p>
<p>The highlight of. the morning was Dick's adult baptism. I did not miss that. There was a reception afterwardsdd</p>
<p>Sitting with friends, coffee and. a light lunch, I described my adventure. A ride home appeared. I gratefully took it. I sent the bread to the pot luck. I was exhausted after the longer than usual walk and. the stress of two detours.</p>
