<html><body><p>I went to my first PT appointment today. Love the therapist. Nick looked at the padded platform and people in strange positions on it and figured it was like a yoga class. He laid down on the floor and went to sleep. 45 minutes on the van to go. An hour and forty-five minutes to return and that doesnâ€™t  count arriving early and needing to wait around for my scheduled pick up.. Definitely learning the bus routes.</p></body></html>
