I read this webpage today. [Holy Name](http://lectionarypage.net/YearABC_RCL/Christmas/HolyName_RCL.html) Without a doubt, the hearer of these texts are to concentrate on the name of Jesus and of all the ways we might engage God's name. But being a more perverse person, that is not where my mind went. In Philippians,Paul says "Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus." (2:5).

What does this mean? I have read these words many times and have often wondered but never stopped to think about them separately. Yes. Yes. Every knee should bow and all that, but what would it mean to have the same mind as Jesus?

The point is Jesus' servanthood, Jesus' willingness to do God's will, to be God with us rather than God apart from us.

And so I begin the year thinking I might have a goal this year to come back to these readings and be Christ to those I meet. It's been a Christian practice forever, but I forget it all the time.

People get nervous around other people when they start spouting religion or say things like, "Jesus loves you." I am not that sort of person. But I can channel it and act as if I had said it.

I want to be mindful of having the mind of Jesus this year. Who knows. It might even become habitual. And isn't that the point of resolutions anyway?)
