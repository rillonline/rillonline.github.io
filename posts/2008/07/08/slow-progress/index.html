<p>Still waiting around to hear about the arrival of the moving truck. Well, experience is handy in these things. Fortunately, I have a place to hang. We even had leftovers last night.</p>
<p>I have learned that the local co-op in Madison delivers to my area and I've had fun reading about all the products I can order. Figuring out poundage as opposed to pieces of fruit will be an adventure. You can also order glass jars and bottles for your stuff to be delivered in if you want to avoid plastic. Meat is pricey because it is organic or free range but then we're all supposed to eat less meat and this is certainly an incentive. I was pleased to discover they have a specific link to Wisconsin cheeses. I could dump most meat for cheese anyway. The coop is full service so there's paper towels, toilet paper and light bulbs, too. Unfortunately, it's a different kind of pet food. There're cleaners in bulk, too. Definitely  not glass there for me. I remember the days when shampoo came in glass containers. Not good. </p>
<p>Yesterday we had a nasty thunderstorm. There was one thunderclap which sounded directly overhead. I asked Elwood if he was scared. He was scared that I wasn't handling thunderstorms well. I don't like loud sounds nearby. My dogs have always handled them better than me. </p>
<p>I've also been looking for a new computer on line. It looks like I will invest in a mini notebook or what some are calling netbooks. </p>
<p>Last night J. asked that we continue listening to a podcast audio drama in the Star Trek universe. I had to download it and melanie took Elwood outside. Fortunately, she noticed he had brought his bone with him and that he had dropped his other bone outside. It would have been very sad to lose bones. Elwood is enjoying chewing on his new bone. I had not realized there are chew areas and when they're all chewed up, it's time for a new bone. 
I've been looking on line for a few things I didn't bring with me, like a vacuum cleaner because mine was overheating.</p>
