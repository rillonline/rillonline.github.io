<html><body><p>There's been some trouble with LiveJournal: people not being able to leave comments or read more recent posts. I do not think the problem is how this particular journal is set up. I hope the problems sort themselves out.

On the 4th melanie and J. went to a picnic. It gave me the chance to do some laundry and chill. I thought it would be a long day and I did not want to expose Elwood to fireworks.

Saturday patience, Melanie and I went shopping in Racine. We have never done anything like this before.

Sunday we went to church. I was told it was the most boring sermon ever. I don't think this is true. It was, however, two sermons in one and not very uplifting. The liturgical music was also very saccharine, including rewriting I heard the Voice of Jesus Say. Yuck. Elwood, like some of the parishioners, went to sleep. Fortunately, he did not snore like the person behind us. 

Afterward, J. and I went for coffee. The fancy drinks must be loaded with sugar and heavy cream. J. had something very tasty, very cold and with unusual seasonings like cardamom. I am sticking to coffee with cream.

The kids took a nap in the afternoon. I washed frying pans.

I bought fruits and vegetables at the local co-op. I wish there is something so near in Madison. I did balk at cherries for $8.99 a pound. Wisconsin milk prices are supposed to be the highest in the country.

Today I read that Dane County, where Madison is, has air pollution above federal requirements. Will I ever get beyond air pollution?

Thunderstorms today. Very humid.     </p></body></html>
