<html><body><p>Melanie and I spent the day picking up little things. We began at Good Will and worked our way up to Bed Bath and Beyond. I now have a 5% discount card at Good Will--disabled people and seniors get one. We also found Elwood a mat for his bowls with blue pawprints on it since he will be eating in the dining room.

J. reviewed the contract and we think we're okay. The difficulty has arisen over under-estimating we think. The company says my things will arrive this weekend. We are off in the morning to start the process.</p></body></html>
