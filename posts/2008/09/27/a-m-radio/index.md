<html><body><p>I've been using the FM tuner in my Iriver mp3 player to listen to my NPR station. In Madison, I get Wisconsin Public Radio so there's little local news but some state news. It's not a really powerful radio. I had my boombox sitting on the work station which wasn't good for reception. I brought it into the dining room but it wouldn't work. The batteries were dead. I finally checked it out in the bedroom and the radio worked if plugged in. I brought it back to the dining room. No soap. On a hunch, I threw the switch in the living room. Voila. This particular socket is controlled by the switch. Now the radio is working fine and the Brewers' game is on. It's a Milwaukee station. Two stations away the same game is playing out of Chicago. Not looking good for the Brewers in the 3rd inning.</p></body></html>
