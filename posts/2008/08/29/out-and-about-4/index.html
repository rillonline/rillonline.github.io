<p>Today we went to the medical center to "establish care". The Dean Medical Center is different from what I'm used to. It began when I called a phone number and got to what felt like a call center for making an appointment. I did speak to a nice person who wasn't rushed. But I had no information on the "office" number or where to find it except that it is in the building across the street. I did know where the front door was. The kids showed me the last time they were here. </p>
<p>So we went out, an hour ahead of our appointment and Elwood marched right up to the door and we did find the desk. A very helpful woman found someone to take me where I was going. I was at a long counter and a very helpful woman signed me in, found me a chair and then returned with more paperwork. Before that was completed, the office nurse turned up to bring me in. This was still more than half an hour before my appointment. I've lost another 5-6 pounds. Hurray! She took my blood pressure and it is better than its been and without medication as I had run out. I did want to test that. Immediately, the doctor turned up and did his thing. He spent more time looking at the computer screen than me, but all is managed by the machine. My pharmacy is listed, etc. There's a pharmacy in the building. </p>
<p>Then lab work was ordered and the nurse wisked me off to the lab which is on the same floor. It was 10 minutes before my appointment. Had I eaten? I was quickly wisked inside and afterwards taken to an outside door. </p>
<p>However, it was not the same door by which I had entered. It was a lovely day. We took a lovely walk. I can't tell you particularly where, but eventually we brushed against some overhanging branches. Ahah! Those are on Fish hatchery Road. We turned around and made our way home, but Elwood decided we should speed past the apartments. We turned around, made an incorrect (via my navigating) into the parking lot that leads to the grocery store, and Elwood and I disagreed about (a) turning around and (b) turning toward home, but in the end he marched right up to the door. Mission accomplished.</p>
<p>At our door was a bone he had brought outside. The apartment staff keeps an eye out. </p>
<p>In my email was the newsletter distributed to apartment residents reminding them about noise, smoke detectors and cleaning swtoves.</p>
<p>I requested and received this week's Sunday bulletin so I will be on track there, too.</p>
<p>Groceries arrived, a different person, who packs groceries differently. Take a bag and put vegetables and fruit in it. Don't separate them. Not really a problem, just a surprise. </p>
<p>I must have screwed up some quantities as I got fewer apples, but apple season lasts a long time. I was able to sort out the cans and label them as well as the bulk items. My new adventures are one of their salsas and a vegie chili mix made with textured soy. I wanted to try this because the direction online say I can make it as is, add tomatoes and/or beans. I thought it had some variation potential. </p>
<p>What continues to fascinate me is what is and is not available. Today green peppers were not available. Fortunately, when I submitted my order I knew this so I ordered purple peppers instead. They're tougher but were just fine with dinner. </p>
<p>I've just about worn out my crocs so S and I are emailing as to colors and wwinter styles. I'll go with a winter style and replace my originals. There's nothing like crocs.    </p>
