Merrill Woolnough, who recently moved to Madison from Jamestown New York, worshiping with us.  Her Seeing Eye Dog named Elwood accompanies her.  Parents and others have asked about how they should relate to the dog. Merrill has asked us to share the following in answer to this question:</p><p>
Elwood is a yellow Labrador Retriever.  He is three years old. We met at the Seeing Eye in Morristown, NJ in December, 2006 where we trained together for almost 3 weeks.</p><p>Seeing Eye dogs are chosen for their intelligence and ability to guide a blind person safely. They are not guard dogs. Protectiveness is not a desired trait because it would limit the blind person's ability to interact socially and professionally. As a result, Elwood is always glad to see people. However, interacting with him is dangerous, not for you, but for me. If he is distracted by a new friend, he may 
not be focused on his job, letting me know about obstacles such as  stairs and walls. This is particularly important in an unfamiliar environment like the church building.</p><p>Please do not touch Elwood or speak to him, especially by name. Using his name is how I get his attention to follow a command.  Thank you.   </p></body></html>
