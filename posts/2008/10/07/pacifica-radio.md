<html><body><p>Just today I was thinking, "Too bad I don't have access to pacifica radio. I want something really out there." In switching my radio from A.M. to F.M. and finding the NPR station I found BBC on the hour and started listening. A Madison station have a fund drive. Oh, my! It's community radio; it's Pacifica. And it's everything I love about Pacifica--irreverent and smart-alecky and they have a labor news segment, a woman's news segment and every kind of music you can think of. Once a week they have a 2-hour show in Mong. Democracy Now airs here so I'll get to check it out after hearing an interview on On The Media. This is one of the reasons I moved to madison, to get some real local flavor. Who would think Pacifica would be here. Just listening to the books they are giving away for becoming a member could be worth the price of admission. A great line: Free Speech Ain't Cheap. And their tea-shirts are union made.</p></body></html>
