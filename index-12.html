<p>My sister looked at google maps for me and worked out a basic walking route. We tested it out today. There is still construction at West Wingra and South Park so that direction was blocked as was West Wingra to Fish Hatchery crossing South Street. So we walked on the opposite side of the street, down Appleton to a busy street which I later determined was Fish hatchery. We retraced our steps--Elwood hates this part--and crossed, going up to Midland and along to Fish hatchery, crossing Appleton and going down to West Wingra. That's a strange crossing, but Elwood is a champ and knew where to go and with the traffic running on Fish Hatchery, I figured we were pretty safe. We can't walk along the river/creek on Planert because there isn't a path, so we crossed and walked on the other side of the street. I'm wondering if there is a store at the corner of South Park because I heard someone making those paging noises out to the street which I often here at big stores. We crossed over the water--a very steep bridge--and had to walk all the way back to along West Wingra to Fish Hatchery, up to Appleton, and back down to South and West Wingra to cross. Elwood hasn't figured out yet which building is ours from this direction, but fortunately I now know the step up to --51 is different than our entrance. We went in the front door of our building after that. We had never done that before. Come to think of it, we could have stepped off --51's stoop and gone into our building. I'm just not wired that way just yet. It'll be a shock to Elwood when we do that. </p>
<p>We also did laundry, put a box downstairs and found a few things that had been put into storage that I wanted back in the apartment. Chip replaced the missing brackets for the bookcase and now the books are on it and that project is basically complete. Bit by bit the ends of boxes are going down though carrying things down to the basement is a bit tough since if Elwood comes that leaves me only one hand and if he doesn't come I could get hopelessly lost in the basement. Fortunately, he waited quite nicely at the bottom of the stairs while I carried an awkward box upstairs and continued to wait while I came back for him. I'm always concerned about him getting tangled in his leash on the stairs. He also waits so nicely while I'm doing the wash. It's quite a little miracle.   </p>

<p>Given Elwood';s desire for outside time, we went for a walk. We took West Wingra to the corner of South Park, crossed and followed the bike path to Fish Hatchery and then south along Fish Hatchery. Lots of cyclists. One of the things about not being church-connected is you find out what people do on Sunday mornings--shop at the coop and cycle and go to coffee shops so far as I know. We came back to South Park and crossed. It turns out the north bound lane is closed for construction. Lots of stones and dirt. We navigated the crazy intersection at the next corner. I wasn't 100% clear on where we were when Elwood stopped at the coffee shop door. We went in and I had lunch, inquiring how many streets down Olen is. Some consternation. People don't carry this information around with them. But, as I expected, the couple at the next table went outside, looked and came back to report. I also learned the hair "hair cutting place" is on the next corner. Good to know as I need one. We found Olen and the button when someone came along to walk with me across the street because of the construction. We found our way to the grocery store--I was up for going to the corner and making a longer walk but Elwood knows the grocery store so we went there. Then Elwood went exploring. A pair of women rescued us and, with some suggestion of furthering our walk, we made our way home. Elwood was clear about the driveway and the outside door. See, I found it, so it got much congratulations about finding the coffee shop and finding his way back home. His sojourn at the grocery store had to do with dumpsters. Defintely of interest to dogs. It's sticky out there so we were glad to come home to a cooled apartment. I had turned the air on to be ready to receive hot person and dog.</p>

<p>Elwood and I went to the grocery store today. We went off early and arrived at the store with help from others entering the store. We located customer service with help and received it promptly. The helper was very straight forward: What should I do? We traveled about the store, picking up a few items. The helper stayed with me through checkout. The cashier wanted to know how I wanted my cash back and, since I asked that my groceries be put in my carry bag, if I was taking the bus. Our helper got us out of the store. We returned to the parking lot we need to traverse. Wow! This is going great. Then I find myself on a street with traffic on my left instead of my right if we are to be going back to the apartment with about 10 pounds of groceries. I turn around. Elwood suggests we cross a street and start investigating a residential area. I decide to retrace our steps and one thing led to another and we are walking down the sidewalk of a busy road. I heard a buzzer to indicate a signal change and hoped we were on South Park. Elwood hesitated, then went on. We walked. No one was out and about. We walked some more. I didn't have my cell phone but then again, who would I have called? I kept thinking we'd hit the corner but the sidewalk seemed to go on forever. I hoped this was not a street I had never been on. Remembering that the corner of West Wingra and South park is a long walk, and yet not coming to it, I turned around. Elwood was grumpy and I was short with him. He turned into a parking lot. With luck, this was the grocery store and yes, it was. A very helpful man wanted to know if we were going inside and I said no and we went into the parking lot again. Elwood thought we might cross South Street and stood firm on that for a short while, but then did indeed turn toward home. But he didn't turn into our driveway and kept walking and walking. Were we on our street? I decided to turn around because if we were, we had passed our building. Elwood turned into a driveway but the step up to the door wasn't right and my key doesn't work in that building's lock.. We tried again. We went to the front of the next building. I decided to find our driveway and we went up the next one. Yes, this was ours. Elwood had found it.</p>
<p>We weren't gone all that long. We hadn't walked forever or been really, really llost. It just seemed that way because I didn't know where we were. Fortunately, I can hear the south park traffic most of the trip to and from the store so I now know to use that info and to know I think we have walked further than we have in reality . I also learned the store is busy in the afternoon on Saturdays and to go there in the morning. I also learned that people of both genders and a variety of races are pleasant and offer to help in this neighborhood.   </p>

<p>This morning Elwood and I took out the trash and the recycling. Lots of odds and ends. He sat quietly while I got everything into the right dumpster. Then we took boxes down to the basement. This is a bit awkward since there are the stairs, the boxes and us. I ended up having him sit inside the basement while I maneuvered the boxes inside. The door is heavy and spring-loaded so that it remains loccked. I didn't want to catch any part of him in the door. Then I manuevered the boxes around the corner and picked him up to go to the storage unit. Then Elwood sat quietly again while I stowed them. It's so impressive, this waiting patiently and not going off about dog business. </p>
<p>My stove was repaired. A screw was missing or misaligned so that I couldn't just pop it in. The shelf in the bedroom closet was flipped to avoid splinters and the right socket for the bedroom switch was located. I didn't realize that the particular socket of the outlet was key though I had identified the correct outlet initially. The thermostat and hooks will be done when maintenance returns from vacation. This is more important for cold weather though it is cool today. It is supposed to be hot but isn't yet. All in all, after two weeks, there is a lot of progress.</p>

<p>There have been grumbles that I haven't updated this journal recently. I guess that is because I've been tired and frustrated with my internet service. I guess I'll have to get on that soon because it isn't working with my wireless router and that is a real pain. </p>
<p>There are still some boxes to be unpacked, some stuff to go down in the storage area and some odds and ends of packing materials to go in the dumpster. Elwood is very good about finding the dumpster and the recycling dumpster which is behind it.</p>
<p>And then there will be lugging wash to the basement with Elwood and getting more stuff downstairs and not getting lost in the basement. I forgot to make a turn and we were all over the place. Add to that the boxes I put down and then had to find again to put in my storage area. </p>
<p>One of the great things about Elwood is that he sits quietly while I put things in and out of the washer and dryer. Caitlin would have been long gone. It's odd using a front loader again. I haven't done this since college and had to be reminded that the soap gets put in somewhere else than on the clothes.</p>
<p>Ordering from the coop works well. I still have to learn how much of what I want. However, Elwood can get us to and from the local grocery store so there is a backup plan. I just have to find customer service and see how that goes.</p>
<p>Everything else is coming along very slowly. I always have these ideas that I'll have all my connections in place. It just isn't happening quickly. The unpacking and figuring out where things go. There is a lot of shelf space here but things are going in different places than in previous situations so everything takes a lot of thought. It also has been warm and I have been reluctant to use the air conditioner.</p>
<p>There are still some repairs to be made to the apartment, some missing hooks and several of the burners for the stove were not connected. One needs to be repaired. The maintenance person has been on grand baby arrival duty so this is taking a little longer.</p>
<p>I now know the garbage truck comes on Wednesday afternoons. They cut the grass and both are very noisy.</p>
<p>The corner on the way to the bike path is under construction. We will check on that again soon. Elwood and I could use a good walk. Evenings bring mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Sara called for a meet up while she was in Madison which was a surprise. We had a short but intense visit as I wanted to learn about her plans. We went to the local coffee shop to review this again with Elwood and it gave me a chance to cross the medical center parking lot when it had cars in it. He is great about this--very reliable and knows his way home.</p>
<p>I have put the apartment on toy patrol since he does occasionally bring a toy outside and if i hadn't said anything, they would have been tossed as the maintenance people do grounds patrol. Now that they are alerted his toys will be returned.</p>
<p>J. and melanie were here over the weekend and helped with things around the apartment. We had a lovely dinner of gazpacho and quisedias. We are hoping to have patience and Brian join us for an outing in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>I got unburied enough to be able to sit in a chair by the window and read without doing anything. It was great.</p>

<p>J. and Melanie have just left. The goods came today. The poundage was right because there is stuff all over the place. We think the hussle is telling you that you have far less stuff than you really have. I think by a studio they mean a dorm room, etc. <br><br>It's been a gorgeous day. Melanie and I left early this morning for the coop. For $10 I got a year's membership as a disabled person. This entitles me to a 10% discount. I bought enough food to already pay for the year's membership. <br><br>You can buy shampoo in bulk. By this I don't mean you get a large container. I mean you can buy it by the ounce. You can also purchase a handy container which you can bring and reuse. The pasta is sold this way, too, along with olive oil, rolled oats and honey to name a few items. We brought home coffee in cups made with water-based ink and cheese Danish. Melaniue had scrambled eggs for breakfast. We went for lunch at the local coffee shop which is very friendly. <br><br>One of the traffic lights has a buzzer to tell you when the walk sign comes on. Elwood has identified the local grocery store. The medical center parking lot is empty on weekends.<br><br>The sound proofing isn't the greatest, but the setting is terrific. There's been a nice breeze. I found I had two extra windows, one in the dining area and one in the living room.<br><br>Right now there are too many boxes about. Winter clothing and Christmas decorations are already in the storage area which has a wooden floor to get things off the basement floor. <br><br>M, thanks for the notes on the boxes. They were read.<br><br>The driver was pleasant and complained about how the truck was packed. He is off to Michigan and then to New Jersey. The dispatcher called to say the driver wouldn t deliver until Sunday because he got caught in traffic in Chicago. <br><br>I'm blogging from the phone. The cable box did not arrive so I have to track that down tomorrow. Cell coverage is dodgie on both my network and Melanie's. However, voice mail is received. I'll keep you updated here and hope the internet gets sorted soon. Everyone in Madison has their networks locked down.</p>

<p>Melanie and I spent the day picking up little things. We began at Good Will and worked our way up to Bed Bath and Beyond. I now have a 5% discount card at Good Will--disabled people and seniors get one. We also found Elwood a mat for his bowls with blue pawprints on it since he will be eating in the dining room.</p>
<p>J. reviewed the contract and we think we're okay. The difficulty has arisen over under-estimating we think. The company says my things will arrive this weekend. We are off in the morning to start the process.</p>

<p>We went out for dinner at Qudoba to celebrate Melanie's birthday. Afterwards, we walked outside. The band played Celebrate. Then thunder and a downpour. Melanie had an umbrella. Half of Melanie was under the umbrella. Half of me was under the umbrella. None of J. or Elwood was under the umbrella. When we got inside, J. went to dry his hair. We looked at a few things in the mall then went to Barnes and Noble for a coffee and to get warm and a little dryer. AFterwards we picked up a few things at Trader Joe's. Now we are home. Elwood got dried off and we are a bit dryer, too. </p>
