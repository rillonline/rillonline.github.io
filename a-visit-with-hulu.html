<p>
Today we went on the bus to visit our friends Sara and Hulu.
</p>

<p>
Hulu is going to stay a while with Sara. We thought she might have to go to the prison program right away, but it has been decided that she needs to stay outside for a while longer.
</p>

<p>
We took a short walk around the neighborhood for practice. Nina was working on curbs and ramps, lining herself up properly and keeping me safe. Hulu was working on walking beside Sara and not being distracted by blowing leaves and noisy school children. She had to walk on a metal grate. Nina already knew this device and made a point of us going around it.
</p>

<p>
Hulu still jumps up and tries to play with me as if I was another dog, using teeth but not hurting. She is such a sweet thing.
