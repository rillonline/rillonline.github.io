<p>It is not remarkable for someone to take the bus. It is not remarkable for a blind person to take the bus. Twenty years ago I took the bus home from the Princeton Junction Train Station regularly. Nevertheless, I feel very accomplished. I took Nick to the vet on the bus by myself recently.</p>
<p>We walk to the bus stop. This involves crossing a busy street and walking (according to Google) one tenth of a mile. We successfully locate the pole which functions as a bus stop indicator. Nick is quite excited to find the pole since he received a treat the last time he showed me the pole. His nose goes to the pole as if it is a magnet. I do not disappoint him. Today will be a day of copious treats. </p>

<p>There is some sort of problem with the man in front of me paying his fare. It seems he has been arguing with the driver from the previous stop. Once that is resolved there is some sort of reset needed before I can tap my prepaid card. I am not sure what that is all about. Another passenger inelegantly helps me to a seat. She also inelegantly helps me off the bus, but I do get off at the correct place, crossed a quiet street controlled by a traffic light and find the vet's office. (I previously made this trip with an instructor so Nick and I know where the building is and how to get inside.) Again Nick sniffs a tree outside the office and availed himself of their grass for a pit stop. I suspect he is not the only dog who has done so.</p>

<p>Happily all Nick’s paperwork is in order. Our appointment goes well. Nick has gained a few pounds but as he was a few pounds underweight when we came to Milwaukee, this is fine.</p>

<p>I am able to pay my bill and leave independently. Someone coming into the office holds the door open for us. Nick and I find the street we need to cross in order to wait for the bus on the other side of the street. Nick eagerly locates the push button because another treat is in the offing. (He received several treats in the office as he needed blood work for some routine tests and a number of yearly vaccinations.) We cross the street and wait for our bus.
I have no idea when the bus will come. I did not checked the schedule. At some level it does not matter. I did not know exactly when Nick’s appointment would be over and I was not going to rush. The vet made sure we would not have to come back until next year. I will have to stop by to pick up refills on Nick’s medications but we do not have to make another vet visit for another year unless something comes up.</p>

<p>Amazingly, Nick sat patiently waiting for the bus. I have never known him to do anything like this before. Nick is rarely patient and he does not like to sit, popping up immediately after every command. Yet, here he sits, letting me know what a veteran traveller he is and how perfect a guide dog he is.</p>

<p>The bus pulls up and it is the same driver. This time I have no trouble tapping my card. The driver directs me to a seat. The trip goes without incident. When we arrive at our stop, the driver advises me he is not at the intersection and clarifies my walking direction for me. A woman directs me across one busy street and another woman walk with me across the second busy street.</p>

<p>It was a successful outing and boosted my confidence greatly. I was never especially anxious either. That is a significant change for me. Nick, for his part, took it all in stride. Just another day in the life of a working dog.</p>

<p>The concert began. Nick has trouble laying down on command. I don't really know why. Perhaps he needs a good reason to do so. No amount of scolding or tugging on his collar has much effect. As a compromise Nick will accept, I work to get him to sit and hope he will eghentually sink to the floor. This has worked in the past at church in thepew.
After some time, Nick did lay down but popped up again as each grade exited the risers and a new group of children came in. Finally, I realized Nick's difficulty in knowing how to behave stems from his lack of experience. He had never been to a program like this before. He had no problem laying quietly on the floor while the African drums pounded out their rhythms or when people laughed at the antics on stage. The thunk thunk of the microphone in its stand didn't bother him. These distractions Nick understands. All my dogs have jumped up when there is applause, but they get used to it in time and ignore it.ick simply did not know what to expect and could not tell when the concert was over. And if nickDoesn't understand what is going on and what is expected of him, he is going to stand or sit up and evaluate the situation until he does .</p>
<p>Given his inexperience, Nick behaved very well and I anticipate his understanding of appropriate behavior will continue to grow with subsequent exposures to school programs and other child-based activities.</p>

<p>On Saturday Nick and I finally got out of the house. We were able to walk to the library and back. Nick is starting to get a really good feel for icy conditions. He is very cautious. I need to encourage him a lot.</p>
<p>as we went along, Nick stopped for no apparent reason. Halfstep by half step, we inched forward. I kept encouraging him. He kept looking at me, trying to make me understand. At last, I came to a planter. We were definitely out of sync. I wanted to go forward. Nick was trying to explain that my direction would run us right into the planter. I wasn't following where we needed to go. Once we sorted it all out, Nick took off again. I praised him highly. He had figured it out. Or at least, I wanted him to think so so that he would do that again.</p>
<p>Nick is very careful when crossing streets. Ice and snow and water are dangerous. He moves very slowly and stops a lot. More encouragement. He can do this. And when he does, more praise. We will sort all this out in time.</p>
<p>Nick was trained during the spring and summer so he has no training about winter traveling conditions.</p>

<p>it is snowing again. I took Nick out. When he's on the leash and the snow is covering the ground, it is very difficult to keep my bearings. Fortunately, I can usually tell where my apartment building is. However, if I move from where I walk out into the snow, and I usually do, it is hard to know where I am when I come back to the sidewalk. Tonight I miss judged. I ended up underneath the wooden staircase that leads up to the second story. I bumped into several posts and treds, getting my hair full of very wet snow. Poor Nick got himself tangled with the leash under the stairs. It was on the lower stairs, though and I couldn't finish the leash out. So I found Nick, and then pulled the leash through. Fortunately, it did not hang up. I am learning to keep my door open – – the apartment is very warm so this is actually helpful – and my music was playing. I found the way to get back inside.</p>

<p>I have been putting off writing this article. for some time because preparing for a new dog is more than looking forward to a long-anticipated outing. Getting a new guide dog requires physical, mental and emotional preparation.</p>
<h3 id="thephysical">The Physical</h3>

<p>As a guide dog ages, it slows down, just like we do. Because their life span is shorter, the slow down is more noticeable. Consequently, I have been walking slower and slower for some time. Now that I am using a white cane, I am walking even more slowly.</p>

<p>To remedy this, I worked out on a treadmill twice a week. This is not intensive training, I know, but I hope it will get my body used to moving faster and I will be more ready to walk with a much younger dog in his or her prime.</p>

<p>I keep up with my Senior Center exercise class twice a week. I also go to yoga classes two evenings a week.</p>

<p>The treadmill work will not continue when I return home. It is too hard on my legs and feet and does not fill in for walking. The walking pace is quite artificial and does not represent the way I walk with my dog. The exercise and yoga classes will. continue. I am switching to three yoga classes and one exercise class. My plan is to add several long walks each week. We will have to learn new routes together to accomplish this.</p>

<p>I have changed my exercise program for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>The yoga classes are more intense for me. I think I am ready for this increase in activity.</li>
<li>The yoga classes are all in the same venue—a clean space where the dog will be in the same general place under the same conditions for each class. I am hopeful this will allow us to develop good habits which will last for our entire partnership.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="mentalandemotionalpreparation">Mental and Emotional Preparation</h3>

<p>I have lumped these two categories together although I know they can be quite different. I am not sure where one ends and the other begins for me in my preparation.</p>

<h3 id="startingtheprocess">Starting the Process</h3>

<p>The process of preparing for a new dog begins with the old dog. For a year or more I talked about getting a new dog. I was trying to talk myself into it. I made excuses: </p>

<ul>
<li>The floor was too hard for old bones.</li>
<li>With time, the dogs just get too smart.</li>
<li>I told myself my dog, Elwood, was still doing his job well–and he did up to the last.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this made it very difficult to sit down at the computer in January and start filling out the “paperwork”. The link “When partnerships end” on the website didn’t help. I wanted my partnership with Elwood to last forever.</p>

<h3 id="waiting">Waiting</h3>

<p>Elwood and I kept working together while I waited. I had a tentative class date. It passed. The time was upon me to say good-bye to Elwood and send him off with his new family on their all-summer vacation. I hope to and a half months away will solidify his affection for his new family–people he has known for two/thirds of his life–and be enough of a separation from me that seeing me again will not divide his loyalty. (Elwood is a very loyal dog.) He is also very, very clear about who puts food in his bowl.</p>

<p>Waiting for a class date to be confirmed is a very discouraging process. It is easy to place blame on others or to be convinced there is favoritism. I have no idea what has taken so long. I just can’t imagine the “right dog” is that hard to find or I am such a unique individual that the right dog is so hard to come by.</p>

<h3 id="gettingreadytotravel">Getting Ready to Travel</h3>

<p>Somewhere along the line, I stopped liking travel. Perhaps it was the number of moves I have made. I just want to stay where I am.</p>

<p>But I have realized I am limiting my travel so much that I am not doing the things I want to do. To this end, I have set myself some goals and I have already achieved one of them by using Uber.</p>

<p>Using a white cane, I learned my neighborhood in a different way. I hope it will help me become more independent and confident when I return with my new dog.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Although saying good-bye to a partner is excruciatingly painful, I am confident I have done as much preparation as I could to be able to start the adventure of a new and successful partnership.</p>

<p>This blog has material from two previous blogs on LiveJournal. I imported them here earlier this year. Admittedly, there is a major gap between 2009 and 2016. Perhaps there’s some stuff on Facebook, but, apparently, I wasn’t blogging and writing much about myself. You can take this two different ways:
</p>
<ol>
<li>I just wasn’t interested or got around to doing it.</li>
    <li>I am a selfless person and writing about myself was distasteful to me.</li>
</ol>
As I am not a particularly selfless person, you can just call me lazy.
<p>Now I am starting to blog again because I am getting a new guide dog and writing about this experience is a lot of fun.</p>

<p>I am happy to report that I will be going to the <a href="https://seeingeye.org">Seeing Eye</a> at the end of July to train with a new dog.</p>
<p>This interim time has been very difficult for me.</p>

<ul>
<li>I really miss Elwood. (For his part, Elwood is thoroughly enjoying retirement even more than I expected.)</li>
<li>Working with a cane if very frustrating.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, I am learning the Blind Square app and striking out on my own, joining a second yoga class and getting there on my own.</p>

<li>I really miss Elwood. (For his part, Elwood is thoroughly enjoying retirement even more than I expected.)</li>
<li>Working with a cane if very frustrating.</li>
</ul>
