<p>Such a beautiful day ! Elwood and I walked up to Curve. The woman I had met when the mobility instructor and I first checked it out was there. "You came back," she said. I explained I had come last Thursday. It turns out she is off Wednesday and Thursday. I had an omelet--definitely dinner, huge and good.It was twice as much as the eggs I had last week so they're a better bet most of the time. Then we walked back, definitely our exercise for the day. The people who sit at the counter help out with seating. We sat against the wall because I thought it might protect Elwood better. It's tight for a left-anded eater.<br><br>In other food news, my friend baked a wonderful loaf in my bread machine. I now have bread machine and bbread in the house. She also gave me the recipe and the ingredients should be arriving with my other groceries later today. The coop has dried mulberries so I will find out what they taste like. I only know what Dr. Souix's POV character saw on Mulberry Street and to think there is a Mulbery Street in Trenton. I also learned, because the coop gives such info, that most dried fruit has sweetener of some kind added as well as oil. Prices are all over the place, but fortunately I can purchase small amounts. I also learned about salt since I needed some of that, too, for the bread. Sea salt comes fine and coarse and in bulk. So does the laundry detergent. <br><br>I stopped at the local grocery store yesterday. Unfortunately, they gave me vanilla yogurt instead of plain. This particular vanilla wasn't horrifically sweet. It tasted almost like vanilla pudding. I understand it is difficult because they look alike. I will have to ask for someone who reads English well. The woman that most often helps is a good egg, but I do not think she reads well in English and depends on what things look like and the peopole in the particular departments for assistance.  <br><br></p>

<p>We went to vote this morning. I was 553 around 9:45. My polling place is in a low income apartment building. So there are the people sitting outside. It is teashirt weather in Madison. Snow and rain possible for the weekend, but right now we are having weather in the 60s and 70s. Then there's inside. The lobby has people in it, too, all over anxious to be helpful. <br><br>On Sunday one of my ride companions showed me the inside of the building. She lives there. The elevator was out of order and we did the stairs because the voting is set up in the community room. Today the elevator was working. It's brailled but of course I had to figure out where I was going. I decided 1. There were people outside of the room. It turns out the poll people do not officially recognize whoever these people were as being allowed to be within range of a polling place. Nevertheless, they were helpful in directing me. A man then took me to the first table and yes, indeed, I am registered. He thought I needed to register. I brought my utility bills just in case. I did check on the Wisconsin web site and saw my voter registration information and a sample ballot. I then went to another table, got my ballot and then went to a place to mark it. No curtained area.  Just a place to stand. The man marked my ballot for me. Then we went and put it into the optacle scanner. That was a little tricky, getting it straight. A corner got bent but I've fed enough dollars into vending machines to smooth that out. Then the form grabbed, like the shreadder,and the computer sound indicated it was tabulated. Back to the elevator and figuring out that I had to push 2 to get back to the lobby. Then all the people and finally outside.<br><br>No waiting yet obviously a lot of people have already come through. Wisconsin has beentelling people to vote between 9 and 4:30 if possible. No stickers. No fuss.We will go out to lunch to celebrate our successful negotiation of a new process.</p>

<p>We've just come back from the groomer's. Pet Smart has a salon. It took longer than we're used to, over three hours and Elwood got the upgraded package, "Top Dog", treatment. He got an oatmeal bath, extra, moisturizers, good for dry skin and his teeth brushed which he apparently liked and tried eating the toothbrush. I was able to get him out of hock for $45. This is more than twice as much as I paid in Lakewood. He looks great. My friend picked me up; I bought coffee and at the café but was treated to soup and sandwich dinner at their house. C makes bread in a bread machine so L took my bread machine back with him after droping me off so that C could check it out. I was never successful at making bread in Jamestown. We'll see what can be done. I've been romised my bread machine back with a loaf of bread Sunday. We'll see what transpires.<br>Meanwile, it was a shirt sleeves day here. Elwood and I went to the library to return books and pick up books. The cassettes are degraded, I think, so I'm reporting as I go. Elwood went past the library driveway and brought me into a construction zone. They're doing the water lines near the library. The dump truck driver came to help. He said he had seen me around. He walked me to the library. If Elwood had done the right thing, we would havenever gotten involved in the construction. On the other hand, we wouldn't know about it and given the driver a chance to stretch his legs. Everything works out.</p>

<p>Well, I'm over my cold. it was certainly nasty. Elwood was irritated that we didn't go anywhere.</p>
<p>We've had 2 mobility lessons and we'll be having our final lesson next week. Elwood is still resisting the library run but I have a much better feel for it. I've been picking up cassette books, not my favorite way of reading anymore, but the library has a lot of books on cassette. i have my bom box and the player from the library for the blind. Unfortunately, the tapes have a lot of background noise on them, the book itself either slightly ahead of slightly behind which makes listening a challenge though doable. I just finished a biography ofDorothy L. Sayers which was supposed to be complimentary but I decided she wasn't terribly likable though her friends found her generous and funny. It is so easy to request books, now that I know how to do the search, that I'm afraid I will always have stacks and stacks of books.
Today we did some fun. We learned where several cool eateries in our area are. I had breakfast at Curve. Curve is about six or seven blocks away, with a major street crossing and the only audible signal in my area. We traipsed off and found the place all right. When I walked in, I realized the joint was jumping. I had gone after what I judged to be prime breakfast time. But then again, today and tomorrow is teacher's convention and school is closed. The women and children were at the tables. The men and I sat at the counter. I walked in and stood against the wall, not sure how to proceed. A man at the counter directed me to a seat. The counter man, and wait staff, cashier, et al asked if I wanted coffee. There was a great place for Elwood under the counter. I ordered eggs. "Wheat toast?" the man asked. It must be Madison. And that's what came, just 2 eggs and two pieces of toast. The hard part was getting him to slow down enough to pay. The man to my left ate and left and another man came who didn't even realize he was sitting next to a dog. He flagged the counter man down and eventually, I paid and could leave. I'lll definitely go back. There's a crew of regulars.
We also stopped at the hardware store to pick up some CFL light bulbs. The counter is at the door so you just say what you want and that's that.
I worked with Melanie and with the office manager here at the apartment to learn the way to the polls. It's across the audible signal street and down 3 blocks. I can't get inside the building to scope it out but assume building will be open on Tuesday and that there'll be enough people around that I will get to where I'm going.
I had a great visit with J. and Melanie. We went to Lazy Jane's which is downtown. It's in a house. You walk in, give your order, lots of tofu stuff and then wait for your name to be bawled throughout the house. it must be madison--cream, 2% milk or soy milk for your coffee. We sat upstairs and Melanie fetched our food when called. You stack your tray and leave when done. We stopped by the coop and St. Vinnie's. They were having their bicycle clearance sale. The bikes are in the basement and apparently at the end of October they close it for the winter. The bikes were 75% off.
it turns out my storm windows were put on backwards, but that has been fixed.
A warm day today. Don't know how long this will last. It was freezing cold Monday with a few snow flurries.
I haven't been to the Wednesday night group for 2 weeks. I was sick the first week and my driver was sick yesterday. To be continued.
Tomorrow Elwood and I need to go back to the library and hopefully I have the documentation to get him a bath. They needed his medical records, well, the rabies shot info. His tag says 20 04 which doesn't mean he got the shot in 2004. He wasn't born until 2005.
Nanowrimo starts Saturday.</p>

<p>On Friday I was able to go to an apple orchard which had many varieties of airloom apples. I bought some Harolds and Prairie Spy. I wondered if Prairie Spy are related to Northern Spy, but the woman didn't know. We talked about how people from new jersey long for Stamin Winesap apples but no one outside of new Jersey has ever heard of them. I also bought a pumpkin with a very nice stem to sit on the table.</p>
<p>On the way home, I felt a sore throat coming on and I'm down with a cold. Quite nasty. I haven't had a cold in a long time. I think Wisconsin germs got to me before i could develop some resistance against them.</p>
<p>I rested and stayed home from church as well. Today has been busy. I worked with a mobility person in the morning. I discovered I was working with incorrect information on the library and that is why I didn't turn at the right place. Now that is sorted out. The area is doing a lot for people in Spanish and trying to get folks up and running. Everyone was very pleasant at the library and the MATC extension. That is where they are teaching in English, in spanish and in both to give people skills.</p>
<p>Later, cousin Tom came with friends to work on the router. Success! I now can connect wirelessly and I'm all incripted.</p>
<p>I had a wonderful plate of tomato soup at the coffee shop and an egg sandwich for dinner. My shopping list for tomorrow's delivery has honey for my tea, lozengers with zinc,, throat soothing tea and some cans of tomato soup. The coop doesn't carry familiar brands so I'm
experimenting with Amy's Kitchen and finding low fat and low salt items. Not alll of Amy's are like this. I bought a larger container of milk, too. I've been a bit hampered by not having some ready made items on hand. Amy's Kitchen lists its nutritional info and ingredients on-line so it is a good brand to use.</p>
<p>Mother suggested gargling with salt. I had forgotten about that and it really helped. I stopped off at Walgreen's and bought some "walfed". It sounds bad but I think it is helping.</p>

<p>Someone asked about Pacifica Radio. I would characterize it as leftist. What interests me about Madison's station is that it is mostly volunteer and has lots of local programming and announcements. The Socialists are having a pot luck and a program. Radio shows are developed by collectives. Want to join? Here are the openings we have. One of the premiums for their pledge drives is Shock Doctrine by Naomi Klein, about disasterous capitalism. I checked. It's over 500 pages and available in audio in an abridged format--9 hours. The local library has 2 copies of the cd set. I thought I would check it out. I'm patron 34 on the waiting list. This doesn't include who's reading the printed text.</p>
<p>It was a glorious fall day. Elwood and I took a walk and received our groceries from our regular driver who greets Elwood and keeps an eye on him so he doesn't wander off. I had a calzone tonight made by the bakery down the street from the coop. I'm also going to try out some frozen food which has a light sodium line. Their web page gave all the nutritional facts and ingredients. They're still a little high in sodium but they are items I probably won't prepare for one. Having the convection oven was really helpful in getting the crust crispy on the spinach calzone. I've never turned on the oven of my stove.</p>

<p>Just today I was thinking, "Too bad I don't have access to pacifica radio. I want something really out there." In switching my radio from A.M. to F.M. and finding the NPR station I found BBC on the hour and started listening. A Madison station have a fund drive. Oh, my! It's community radio; it's Pacifica. And it's everything I love about Pacifica--irreverent and smart-alecky and they have a labor news segment, a woman's news segment and every kind of music you can think of. Once a week they have a 2-hour show in Mong. Democracy Now airs here so I'll get to check it out after hearing an interview on On The Media. This is one of the reasons I moved to madison, to get some real local flavor. Who would think Pacifica would be here. Just listening to the books they are giving away for becoming a member could be worth the price of admission. A great line: Free Speech Ain't Cheap. And their tea-shirts are union made.</p>

<p>It's been a while since I did an emailed post so let's see how this goes.</p>
<p>Yesterday I attended a sort of Taize service at church. I say sort of because it was day 1 of an experiment. I think we were in what some folks would call the chancel but is not called that in a Baptist church. We were where the choir sits, near the piano. Around us people were getting ready for the multi media youth service. Everyone runs late. This experiment will be live for 3 months on the 1st Sunday of the month. You see how confused all this is. We did some Taize singing with some Scripture and some prayer. It lasted half an hour. The pianist doesn't want to play the chants repetitively. Twice and he wants to move on. Singing some in Latin, which he did, blew the other folks away. Fortunately, it was one of the Latin ones I knew so could join him. When we got all done, and we were giving feedback, I said, "I want a kyrie elaison."" I also discovered the others think of prayer as for individuals while I was contributing for this and for this and for this. What can I say? I've hung out with litanies for a long time. Anyway, several more people expressed interest in the service. I ride with the leader and we talked if another time would work for the group though maybe next month more will be interested. It was a good contrast to the youth service.</p>
<p>I managed to drop my bread into the cup at communion. I'm not good at intinction. It's about judging where the liquid is. I'm also "ripping" and "dipping" with my right hand and that is an adventure in itself.</p>
<p>I'm making good progress in reading an entire book for Bible study next week. It comes of giving away all my commentaries and needing one. This book is an approach to Mark which maintains Jesus is a political figure interested in renewal in the agrarian villages of Galilee. It had never occurred to me, and to anyone else as far as I can remember, that Galilee and Judea were under different governments for 800 years or so before they got put under the same governance for about 100 years ending with Herod the Great and then were broken apart again. As a result, the Galileans religious tradition did not include anything after the reign of Solomon.</p>
<p>Elwood and I went on a nice exercise walk today and he did very well.</p>
