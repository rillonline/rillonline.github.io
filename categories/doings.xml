Yesterday the temp went up but the wind chills are fierce. Some light snow overnight and thru the day. I didn't get to the vacuuming so still have it to do. Sadly, Jott is going paid only so i deleted my account. I enjoyed listening to feeds and doing updates from the phone. Maybe I'll get into txt msging after all. The dealer who sold me the Trekker Breeze suggested I get an extended life battery for the xv6700 cell phone. He has this model on Verizon and has had no problems. The battery arrived yesterday with a new back for the phone. It seems to get a better signal in the low signal area of the apartment though it does not increase the signal in the better areas. It's supposed to last longer, too. I'm hoping this resolves some of my cell phone issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>doings</category><guid>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2009/01/14/cabin-fever-3/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2009 15:59:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
