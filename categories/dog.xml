Nick was so funny at dinnertime. I got out his harness. He went into
the bathroom to get a drink but there wasn't much water in the dish. I
hung his harness and leash on the door and filled up his water bowl,
encouraging him to drink some more. He danced around, not sure what to
do. He went into the bathroom but then came out again. Again I
encouraged him to drink but he started butting my legs with his head.
He seemed to be saying, Let's go, so I put his harness on him and off
we went to park.

They would have been 14. Linda and I gave thanks today for them. Through them we have had an enduring friendship by email and phone. Each of these dogs had a sense of humor and made us laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Dog</category><category>Friendship</category><category>Prayer</category><guid>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2019/01/08/giving-thanks/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jan 2019 02:31:55 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
