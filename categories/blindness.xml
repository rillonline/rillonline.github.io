In fact, I got sweaty on the way home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed to return some books to the library. the library has a wonderful system whereby I could opt in to receive email notices when books are due. In fact, i had three to return so off we went this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of dry pavement out there but also a lot of slush and some uncleared places. There is still a high snowbank with a narrow opening at one intersection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned something new about the Trekker Breeze GPS. I used my route to get to the library. I really don't need it anymore. Street announcements are sufficient. Instead of backtracking, I tried selecting the landmark of my home from the library to generate a route. As the library is in a strip mall, the Breeze informed me that I was too far from any road to generate a route. Elwood and I made our way to South Park Street and I tried again. I was successful. Elwood sat down to wait for me to be ready. These people and their toys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was curious to know how I would be sent. The Breeze retraced the route I had taken. It's probably the shortest way. However, I discovered another limitation. When we got to the West Wingra intersection, it told me to turn left but did not indicate if I should cross West Wingra or not. If I did not, I would be on the bike path. It might be difficult to discern where to cross Wingra to take advantage of the crosswalk. There is not a light at this 3-way intersection. Making the crossing with the light at the 4-way intersection at park allows me to simply turn when I get to South. I suppose this is knowing your area and trial and error to pick the correct strategy. The GPS does not ever tell you which side of the street you are on.  Apparently all calculations are from the middle of the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elwood did very well today, including stopping because a vehicle was in a driveway waiting to pull out. I could not hear the vehicle with my hood up and it idling nor could I see it with the angle of the sun. He does this so well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>blindness</category><category>guide dogs</category><category>technology</category><category>trekker breeze</category><guid>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2009/01/21/library-journey/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2009 17:52:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Doings Today</title><link>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2009/01/12/doings-today-2/</link><dc:creator>Rill</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today Elwood went to Pet Smart for his quarterly top dog treatment. I went to the cosmetology department at MATC for a pedicure, manicure, eyebrow waxing  and hair cut. This is a good plan. I will have the same person cut my hair next time which is good because we are trying to straighten everything out from some poor hair cuts previously. I get to listen in on what the instructors tell the student and who knows, maybe I can learn something to tell another operator. I'm hoping the instructors learn my hair. I was also able to get Elwood a new bone and his food on sale as well as get a regular customer discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I brought my GPS with me. I forgot to turn it on at first and it takes a good 20 minutes sometimes to find the GPS signal, but when it did I could listen in as we drove around. My friends made certain I could landmark everywhere we went and gave me exact names. I even have their house marked.
What is very cool about traveling this way is that I learned where the West Town Mall is, that Target is nearby and that Pet Smart and other places are near where the kids looked at an apartment for me. They decided it was a car-friendly area, not a pedestrian-friendly area. We all figured out it was far out of town.
I would not have known all of this if I had left the GPS home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had it on when my friend brought me home. We were stopping off at the library to pick up my books so I won't have to go anywhere tomorrow when the deep freeze will be upon us. I knew where we were and to say where to turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elwood got a red bow to wear out of the spa. He showed more interest in a new bone and chewed happily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ate in a nice restaurant with numerous soup choices. They prepare all their soups gluten-free, adding noodles or rice as a GF alternative when the soup is served. Must keep the noodles and rice from getting gummy, too. I had French garden with basil on top and wonderful crusty bread and butter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also had a chance to stop at a second-hand store. I found a canister for Willie Street Coop bulk items and some warm tops including a purple tunic made of  Italian yarn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>blindness</category><category>outings</category><category>technology</category><category>trekker breeze</category><guid>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2009/01/12/doings-today-2/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2009 02:35:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Doings Today</title><link>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2009/01/12/doings-today/</link><dc:creator>Rill</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today Elwood went to Pet Smart for his quarterly top dog treatment.

With the Trekker Breeze I can record the route and then reuse it. The advantage of doing this is that the Breeze can then give me directions the next time and the time after that. I walk  , turn west, walk north past my side entrance to the street where I can turn west again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the frustrating element of my unit and its route creation. It deleted going south and coming back north. It thought I was backtracking and that therefore it was unnecessary to do. The revised route has me starting out north to the T intersection along the top of the T and crossing to get to the stem of the T. I could do it that way. I don't because there isn't a light at the T intersection and the street I am crossing has the right of way. There is a stop sign as I have outlined the way I actually walked. I cannot continue west but have to "backtrack" because of construction. I could do the T intersection crossing today because the Dean Clinic is closed and there is not a lot of traffic. I would have to landmark the crossing to find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did learn that some of the inaccuracies I am encountering are not the fault of the unit. It cannot be more accurate. Civilian GPS is only accurate to within 30-50 feet. Military GPS is pinpoint accurate. So even civilian aircraft cannot get more accurate positioning than I have. All street announcements are fixed to the middle of the intersection so they don't represent where I am standing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standing itself is a problem. To get an accurate fix, I have to be moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;, I have a street that is not listed on my map at all. It's a 4-way intersection but the Breeze only reports a 3-way intersection. This is because these maps are labeled by people--people not being paid very much. Errors are introduced this way. I have both a missing street and an unnamed street  in my area. Surely the unnamed street truly has a name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing the Breeze cannot do is accurately report which street I am on when two streets are very close together. I have two major roads that come together. It is a triangle, not a square though I often think of them paralleling each other the further they get away from their intersection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I get to where these streets intersect and turn to walk down the other one , the Breeze can't tell for a while that I have moved from one street to the other one. As I move farther away from the point of intersection, more accuracy gets introduced to the reading. It is up to me alone to know that I have made the turn and to know where I am until the Breeze can catch up to me. I don't have a strong sense of direction. I have to use sensory input such as: The traffic is now on my left and the building line is now on my right. I must have made the turn to walk down the other busy street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line here is that GPS can give valuable information, but it in no way replaces mobility skills. In fact, I think it mandates increased mobility skills. I have to evaluate the information I am given to vette its reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope we can keep our date this week to work with an O&amp;amp;M person to put the Breeze thru its paces. I suspect instructors will have to be more aware in future to teach people how to exploit their GPS as well as how to evaluate its accuracy all the while keeping themselves safe and going in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone told me that is what students and others now have to do when evaluating Internet information. Can the source be trusted? Can the information given be fact checked? In the case of my Trekker Breeze, is it telling me what I know to be true? The hard thing is when I'm not sure or when I'm mistaken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>blindness</category><category>technology</category><category>trekker breeze</category><guid>https://rillonline.github.io/posts/2009/01/10/trekker-breeze/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2009 22:17:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
