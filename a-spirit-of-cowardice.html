<p>
I have sought various ways to be connected to Jesus.

None of these work particularly well for me.
</p>

<p>
Recently I have subscribed to a verse of the day email. These can get quite boring and it is easy to read quickly, swipe and be done. The verse is almost immediately forgotten and I go on with my day.
</p>

<p>
I am not a particularly consistent journaler or blogger. That is easy enough to see. But I've decided to try again and write a little on the verse of the day as I am able and see if it can become more habitual.
</p>

<p>
One caveat: These are not "finished" essays. I'm looking for an opportunity for me to interact with the text for my own life and relationship with Jesus. If that helps you, that's great. Otherwise, just move on.
</p>

<p>
Today's verse is 2 Timothy 1:7. From the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV)
</p>

<p>
&gt; for God did not give us a spirit of cowardice, but rather a spirit of power and of love and of self-discipline.
</p>

<p>
I did a little checking. The word "cowardice" has been translated several ways. (I don't recall the Greek. You can look it up if you like. I did.)

<p>
Self-discipline has to do with sound reasoning rather than self-control.
</p>

<p>
So, if I claim to be part of the "us" rather than limiting it to Paul and Timothy, the spirit I have been given is not cowardly but powerful, loving and thinks clearly.
</p>

<p>
In today's world, we are encouraged to get along, to accept there are different points of view and to honor these differences and viewpoints. I think I do that rather well. What this text suggests to me is to not be afraid to express my own opinions and to act when the Spirit prompts me to action.
</p>

<p>
I think I can live with this and pay attention to those times when I am timid. Mostly, I do not identify myself in secular situations as Christian. I say it is because I don't want to attract the razies. I wonder if I am ignoring the spirit Jesus has given me. I'll have to test this out in the coming days.
