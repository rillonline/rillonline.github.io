I'm a science fiction fan. I like a good space opera with spaceships,
aliens and lots of action. I also like science fiction that explores
what if's. Unlike alternate histories, I don't have to know the real
history before I can enjoy the scenario being laid out before me.
</p>

<p>
More specifically, I'm a Trekkie. (Yeah, yeah, I know, we're called
trekkers, but, we were called Trekkies first.
</p>

<p>
The Next Generation episode of Star Trek that changed my life (really,
it did!) is Tapestry. HYPERLINK
"<a href="http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/series/TNG/episode/68588.html">http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/series/TNG/episode/68588.html</a>"

After having his artificial heart short-circuited, Captain Picard has an
opportunity to change the trajectory of his life. As a young officer,
Jean-Luc made a choice that now has fatal consequences for him. When
he's given a chance to undo his behavior, his future life changes, too.
Unfortunately, although he's alive, he's miserable. He has, in this new
life, always played it safe. Picard learns that one of the qualities
that makes his life satisfying to him and, coincidentally, makes him a
good starship captain is taking risks.
</p>

<p>
I hadn't seen the series when it aired. I watched it as late night
reruns. As I laid in bed thinking about this particular episode, I
reflected on my own life. It's a scary thing to see an Enterprise
captain
</p>

<p>
reduced to a mature lieutenant junior grade
</p>

<p>
running errands for his superior officers
</p>

<p>
humiliated by the ship's senior staff who once looked up to him
</p>

<p>
I thought about my own life. I realized I benefited more from the
chances I had taken than the times I had played it safe. For example, I
had left a good paying job at IBM when I was offered a buy-out package.
At the time, people close to me thought my action was foolhardy. Later,
when
</p>

<p>
the site was closed
</p>

<p>
the company's stock dropped dramatically in price
</p>

<p>
those still employed by the company had to interview for jobs as if they
were candidates off the street,
</p>

<p>
My decision looked like a wise one.
</p>

<p>
I learned to take risks with my life and work.
</p>

<p>
Sure. There are things that really scare me, risks I won't take:
</p>

<p>
skydiving
</p>

<p>
Ferris wheels now that I'm too big to have my dad riding between my
sister and me
</p>

<p>
Roller coasters (I did go with my daughter on Big Thunder Mountain
Railroad ( HYPERLINK
"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Thunder_Mountain_Railroad">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Thunder_Mountain_Railroad</a>"
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Thunder_Mountain_Railroad">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Thunder_Mountain_Railroad</a> ) in the
Magic Kingdom. She laughed at my fear. What made the ride almost
bearable was sitting in front of some park employees. One was describing
to the other where you could take people off the ride if you had to.)
</p>

<p>
In Babylon Five when Captain Sheridan is dying on zhadum, Lorien asks
him: ``Who are you? Why are you here?'' HYPERLINK
"<a href="http://www.chronology.org/noframes/b-five/monologues.html">http://www.chronology.org/noframes/b-five/monologues.html</a>"
<a href="http://www.chronology.org/noframes/b-five/monologues.html">http://www.chronology.org/noframes/b-five/monologues.html</a>
</p>

<p>
Sheridan must answer these basic questions about his existence to
Lorine's satisfaction in order to survive.
</p>

<p>
Socrates is purported to have said ``The unexamined life is not worth
living for man.'' HYPERLINK "<a href="http://www.bartleby.com/66/53/54553.html">http://www.bartleby.com/66/53/54553.html</a>"
<a href="http://www.bartleby.com/66/53/54553.html">http://www.bartleby.com/66/53/54553.html</a> Haraman quoted this to me a
long time ago. Because Haraman told me and because I have had many years
to test this saying, I have come to believe it is true.
</p>

<p>
I learned to reflect on my own life
</p>

<p>
I have many favorite biblical passages. Those of us who find solace and
encouragement and challenge in the Bible do. One of them goes like this:
</p>

<p>
For copyright reasons, I'll read this quotation from The Holy Bible,
American Standard Version.
</p>

<p>
He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth Jehovah require
of thee, but to do justly, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with
thy God?
</p>

<p>
(From Micah 6:8)
</p>

<p>
Humble-walking may suggest to you modesty or submissiveness. In
Charlotte's Web ``humble'' was the last adjective Charlotte the spider
used to describe Wilbur the pig. In this context, it meant low to the
ground.
</p>

<p>
In my experience, to walk humbly with my God means
</p>

<p>
An Openness to another point of view
</p>

<p>
a willingness to change my mind
</p>

<p>
a deep desire to align my desires with God's desires
</p>

<p>
Sometimes Christians call this doing God's will.
</p>

<p>
I learned to desire what God desires.
</p>

<p>
So here's the part where I bring my learnings (my spellchecker won't
like this word) together into a spirituality of risk taking. The parts
are:
</p>

<p>
risk taking
</p>

<p>
questions about the nature of my existence
</p>

<p>
a need to examine these questions to draw some conclusions about the
meaning of my life
</p>

<p>
A Scriptural observation about how life is to be lived.
</p>

<p>
a spiritual response to these observations
</p>

<p>
It really boils down to Lorine's questions only Lorine isn't asking
them. I am. God is.
</p>

<p>
Who are you?
</p>

<p>
Why are you here?
</p>

<p>
I believe I ask these questions about myself and God asks me these
questions about myself in prayer.
</p>

<p>
I am calling all these disparate pieces a spirituality of risk taking.
It's still quite rough. I hope to
</p>

<p>
risk more
</p>

<p>
reflect more
</p>

<p>
relate more
</p>

<p>
write more
</p>

<p>
And share more with you in the days ahead.

I am reconstituting this blog with posts that date back twenty years. It's a daunting task but also amusing, boring, delightful and surprising all at the same time.
Today I found an outline of an ebook I started to write on <code>orgmode</code>.
I don't have all the files for it, but I want to find what I have and relearn how to use this powerful mode again. The best I can do is have a tag page for it!.I may need to update the files as I will definitely get a chance to find out how well I described what to do.

<p>
***Narrative
</p>

<p>
You can skip this part if you only want to know how to get sending mail
working on your pi.
</p>

<p>
There was a person who contributed to Hacker Public News (I think they
used a fictional character's name) who once wrote that all instructions
on the Internet had incorrector missing information in their tutorials.
I certainly have found this to be true in this extended saga.
</p>

<p>
In my physical space, I have a pi at a computer stand on one side of the
room and a ChromeBook on the other. I did a lot of walking back and
forth. I use the ChromeBook to search the Internet and copy items of
interest. Now when I search, I always get an AI overview. In general, I
find these overviews to give me the information I need, but not this
time. The information was often outdated or incorrect.
</p>

<p>
I have also come to the conclusion that pages on the ArchLinux wiki do
not first give you the basics but are delighted to give you lots of
other things you can do without stressing what you actually need to get
up and running.
</p>

<p>
Finally, it often takes me a while to realize what part of the examples
are required text and which are placeholders.
</p>

<p>
Take for example the line:
</p>

<p>
<code>account gmail</code>
</p>

<p>
In this case, <code>gmail</code> is an arbitrary name. I could put <code>squirrel</code> or
<code>arugala</code> even when I am defining a <code>gmail</code> account.
</p>

<p>
I have spent days searching, installing, uninstalling and puzzling over
errors. Rince and repeat.
</p>

<p>
OK, on to the way to get it working.
</p>

<p>
***Introduction
</p>

<p>
I wanted a way to move some files off of my raspberry pi onto cloud services like OneDrive and Dropbox. Instead of configuring <code>rclone</code> or a similar service, I figured an email attachment would work just as well. (I totally forgot I could copy files to my PC with <code>scp</code>.) I wanted something quickly and not necessarily elegantly to get the job done.
</p>

<p>
***Installation
</p>

<p>
You need to install three programs:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>msmtp</li>

<li>msmtp-mta</li>

<li><p>
s-nail
</p>

<p>
<code>sudo pacman -S msmtp mstp-mta s-nail</code>
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
That's it! Nothing from the <code>aur</code>.
</p>

<p>
Two caviots here:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If you are using <code>gmail</code> to send your messages, you will have to create an app password for your account. Your regular password will not work.</li>

<li>I did not hide this app password in a key ring. I learned the default program <code>secret-tool</code> requires that a desktop needs to be installed. I didn't want to use <code>gpg</code> or a password manager. Is someone really going to break into my house or network and interrogate my raspberry pi to get into my <code>gmail</code>?</li>
</ol>

<p>
***The .mailrc file
</p>

<p>
Create a file named .mailrc.Include this line:
</p>

<p>
<code>set mta</code>"/usr/bin/msmtp"=
</p>

<p>
***Configure MSMTP
</p>

<p>
Create a file called <code>.msmtprc</code>.Here is the configuration file that finally worked for me. 
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org8c6a879">
auth on
tls on
tls_starttls on
tls_certcheck on
logfile ~/.msmtp.log
host smtp.gmail.com
port 587
from your-email-address
user your-email-address
password your-app-password
</pre>

<p>
This is the barebones I could get away with.
</p>

<p>
***Change File Permissions
</p>

<p>
You must change permissions on the <code>.msmtp</code> file if it contains a
password.
</p>

<p>
<code>sudo chmod 600 .msmtprc</code>
</p>

<p>
***Sending a Message
</p>

<p>
To test this configuration, I used the following command. I sent the
message to a different email account from the one I configured in <code>.msmtprc</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>echo “This is only a test.” | mail -s “Test Message" -a sending-mail.md receiving-msg-account</code>
</p>

<p>
This is one line and includes attaching this file to the email.

<p>
Today the church remembers St. Francis Navier. He wrote to Ignatius
that more evangelists were needed to tell those in Asia about Jesus.
He believed there were people just waiting to hear the good news.
Reading Psalm 62, I can say They are waiting for God alone. 
</p>

<p>
I often think of the people at the time of Jesus as waiting in
silence. Perhaps this is because of Slent Night or perhaps because we
have the Scripture about the people sitting in darkness which implies silence to me. In any event Francis reminds us that many are just waiting to hear our words of forgiveness, love and salvation.
