Write your post here.** Introduction
</p>

<p>
I wanted to know how much my subscriptions were costing me every
month. Subscription fatigue is a popular topic on tech talk shows so I
wanted to see how my useage stacked up and if there was anything
outrageous I could cut.
</p>

<p>
There are a number of tools at my disposal:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A Perkins Brailler and a sheet of paper. I still know how to add up
a column of figures manually.</li>
<li>A spreadsheet program. Let me count the options I have, not going
into how well I think they work or how well I know them.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Microsoft Excel</li>
<li>LibriOffice Calc</li>
<li>Numbers</li>
<li>ses</li>
<li>dismal</li>
<li>Org</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Although not in my little list above, I know word processor programs
have tables and the possibility of formulas, but I decided I could
investigate org tables. I could report on their accessibility with help from Emacspeak.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgdee892e" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgdee892e">Setting Up A Table</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdee892e">
<p>
I decided to create a table with two columns, "ITEM" for the name of
the subscription and "ExPENSE" for the monthly amount I am
spending.
</p>

<p>
There's nothing fancy about setting up an org table. The vertical bar
character "|" delimits columns. If a "|" is the first character in a
line, org understands this to be a table. A two column table with one
row looks like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">

| | |

</pre>

<p>
But I need a table with two headers, a horizontal rule between my
headings and my subscriptions and one row to start.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note</b>: You need a header row with a horizontal rule underneath it   if you want to total a column of numbers.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>
<p>
Type the line
</p>
<pre class="example">

|ITEM|ExPENSE|

</pre>

<p>
Press return. Don't worry about white space
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Type "|-" (vertical bar followed immediately by a hyphen) and press
tab.
</p>

<pre class="example">
| ITEM | ExPENSE |
|------+---------|
|      |         |
</pre>
</li>

<li>Now you have a table ready for input.Your column headings have
white space around them and your horizontal rule is filled in. The
vertical bars to define the columns in the new row are in place.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orged08adb" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orged08adb">Entering Data into A Table</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orged08adb">
<p>
Once the table is set up like this, it is an easy process to fill in many lines of data.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>With point at the third position, type "Amazon Prime".</li>
<li>Press tab. Point is at the third position after the second "|".</li>
<li>Type "8.25" for one month of the $99 subscription.</li>
<li>Press return.</li>
<li>
<p>
Here's what the table now looks like. Notice that the columns have
been adjusted to accommodate the longer text of "Amazon Prime".
</p>

<pre class="example">
| ITEM         | EXPENSE  |
|--------------+---------|
| Amazon Prime |       8.25   |
|              |              |
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
It is important to realize that point is now in the second column.
Either use s=tab to move back one field to the first column or c-a to
go to the beginning of the line and c-f to move to the right of the "|".
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgadea855" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgadea855">Summing Up Expenses</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgadea855">
<p>
When I thought I had listed all my subscriptions, I made another
horizontal rule.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I typed the word "Total" in the first column.</li>
<li>I pressed tab.</li>
<li>I pressed "C-c +" (c-c then the plus sign). This summed up my
expenses and put it in the echo line.</li>
<li>I pressed "c-y" to paste (yank) it into the table at point.</li>
<li>Now I could read the number.</li>
</ol>
<p>
This is fine, but if I added another subscription (perish the
thought!) I would have to go through the process of updating the total
more or less manually. I needed a formula that I could rerun at any
time. Who knows. I might even drop a subscription down the road.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgfa71b7b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgfa71b7b">Some Discoveries</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfa71b7b">
<p>
I created a much more complicated table with many headings for
different kinds of expenses. Most of every column had white space in
it with a few numbers. This doesn't work in Org. The columns cannot be
summarized. Following the example of<a href="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/spreadsheet.html">Lots of Small Spreadsheets</a> I broke
my mammoth spreadsheet into six little ones:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>subscriptions</li>
<li>rent and such</li>
<li>health and wellness</li>
<li>food and drink</li>
<li>dog (for my Seeing Eye dog)</li>
<li>Miscellaneous</li>
</ul>
<p>
Then I created a seventh table to summarize them all.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8255836" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org8255836">Naming Tables</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8255836">
<p>
If each of these tables has a unique name, any field in that table can be
referenced elsewhere in the Org universe. It looks like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
#+NAME: subscriptions
</pre>

<p>
Put this name at the top of the table above the header row. Don't have
any white space in-between this line and the header line. Org needs to
understand they are connected.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org98d079b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org98d079b">How Org References Rows and Columns</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org98d079b">
<p>
To find out where you are in a table, use "c-c ?" (c-c question mark).
To hear the reference again, press "c-e a". You can do this as many
times as you need to until you have it in your mind. I don't know of a
way to put it on the clipboard to be yanked into a text file to be
interrogated.
</p>

<p>
The readout is in the form line number which is prefixed by the "@" (at sign) followed by the
word "col" followed by the column designation in the form "$" (dollar
sign) followed by the column position followed by the compound
expression of row plus column. Finally, a more conventional
spreadsheet reference. So the field in the seventh row in the fifth column is "@7$5" or "G5".
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5c6e3ee" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org5c6e3ee">Putting It Altogether</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5c6e3ee">
<p>
Each of our little tables needs a formula to sum up the expenses
listed in column 2. You write this formula this way:
</p>

<pre class="example">
#+TBLFM: @&gt;$2=vsum(@2..@-1)
</pre>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>"#+TBLFM:" follows the table itself with no white space. I could
not get more than one of these to work per table.</li>
<li>The left hand side of the equation shows where to put the answer.
Put it in the last row, second column.</li>
<li>"vsum" is an Emacs calc function. It will summarize the column for us.</li>
<li>Within the parentheses is the range: from the second row to the
next to last row in the second column. Org does not count the
horizontal lines but it will stop any calculation when it
encounters one.</li>
<li>Press "c-c c-c" on this line and voila! The total appears.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<b>Note</b>: Always blank out your field(s) before initiating a
calculation. You will get some strange numbers if you don't.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3933ab6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3933ab6">The Final Summation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3933ab6">
<p>
Finally, I needed to add the totals from the six tables into
the seventh one. Obviously, I could look at each number and copy it over,
but what fun is that? Besides, every time I added an item to one of
the tables, I would have to copy a new number into the correct field.
</p>

<p>
Enter "#+NAME:" to save the day.
</p>

<p>
I wrote a formula to pick up the total amount from each table, copy it
to the appropriate line in the second column of my summary table and
add it all up. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get the hang of
doing these remote references within the table so I have one huge
"#+TBLFM:" line. It may not be pretty but it works! Here's what it
looks like. It will probably wrap on your screen, but trust me, it's
one line in my file.
</p>

<pre class="example">
#+TBLFM:@2$2=remote(subscriptions,@&gt;$2)::@3$2=remote(rent-and-such,@&gt;$2)::@4$2=remote(health-and-wellness,@&gt;$2)::@5$2=remote(dog,@&gt;$2)::@6$2=remote(food-and-drink,@&gt;$2)::@7$2=remote(misc,@&gt;$2)::@&gt;$2=vsum(@2$2..@&gt;-1$2)
</pre>

<p>
The double "::" (colon) concatenates each equation to the next. When it
all finally worked, the entire column was filled in and the grand
total appeared. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org588fc64" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org588fc64">Some Observations</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org588fc64">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"C-c spc" is a great keybinding to know. It blanks out a field.</li>
<li>Learning how to delete a column or row is useful. Don't be too
zealous. You'll end up wiping out all your hard work entering it.
Moving rows up and down can be accomplished with keybindings, too.
You can learn about all these by going through the tbl menu option. It's good when you don't remember a keybinding like I do.</li>
<li>I did not find the formula debugger very helpful.</li>
<li>I had trouble when my table only had one line of data. The range
confused the program.</li>
<li>If you need to, you can export your table to a csv file.</li>
<li>Being very specific in formulas helps a lot. There are some
shortcuts for cell descriptions, but some of them were harder to
understand and use for me. When I got specific, my formulas worked
much better.</li>
<li>The emacspeak keybindings appear to be duplicates of the org ones.</li>
<li>With simple tables, it is not too hard to review the table with speech.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8334c17" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org8334c17">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8334c17">
<p>
I really like using org for this work. My file is a text file and
easily understood and modified as needed. With a little editing of the
names, I can have a file with each month under a separate headline. I
could keep year-to-date figures as well as compare expenses on a
yearly basis. There is the potential to have a unique identifier for each field.
Tracking utility bills, for example, year over year could come in very handy.

I have been puzzled why tab completion wasn't working in orgmode so I
decided to let the good old Internet help me out.
</p>

<p>
It turns out that my friend Flyspell uses tab completion for
completing words. I don't want to turn off Flyspell since you would
end up reading articles with many misspellings.
</p>

<p>
The suggestion I found was to use m-tab for completions However,
alt+tab only switched me to another window. Enter the escape key!
</p>

<p>
escape=tab does the trick. <code>#+BEGIN_Q</code> becomes <code>#+BEGIN_QUOTE</code> after
pressing escape-tab. Take that Apple. I can't do that on a Mac with a
touch bar. Fortunately, I am not using one for this Linux installation.

<h2 id="orge9990a5">The Problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge9990a5">
<p>
I didn't have a great set up for spellchecking in Emacs. Ispell works,
but often there are too many choices and Emacspeak does not read them
out. So I investigated Flyspell and now I have a working solution.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org13f26ed" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org13f26ed">The Hook</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org13f26ed">
<p>
I now have flyspell working in all text and text-derived buffers by
adding this hook:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'flyspell-mode)
</pre>

<p>
This can be disabled in specific circumstances if needed but this is
beyond the scope of this article.

<div id="outline-container-org5dc9808" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org5dc9808">Procedure to Correct Words in a Buffer</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5dc9808">
<p>
There are keybindings to autocorrect in <code>flyspell</code>, but this is not
always advisable.
</p>

<p>
I needed to be able to scroll through the many options. <code>Ispell</code> gives
choices with numbers, but often there are too many to give you the
list. By putting the following command in my <code>init.el</code> file via the
customization menus, I am now able to use <code>flyspell</code> to cursor up and
down a list until I find the right choice. After that, I can just hit return.
</p>

<p>
If auditory icons is turned on and you are using the default theme,
you will hear something like a rattling sound when you misspell a word. To
correct the word immediately,
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>move point to the misspelled word.</li>
<li>Press c-c $. (control plus c then s plus 4)</li>
<li>Emacspeak will say menu. You can use your cursor keys to scroll up
and down the list of suggestions.</li>
<li>Press return on your selection.</li>
</ul>
<p>
As well as misspelled word suggestions, you can save your word in a
personal dictionary, accept your spelling for this session or accept
all misspelled words in the buffer.

<p>
c-, (control plus comma) can move point from misspelled word to
misspelled word in your buffer. Press c-c $ to correct each one. c-,
will announce when you reach the end of the buffer. Press c-, again to
move to the beginning of the buffer.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb89c888">
<p>
There are other commands which can move point and automatically
correct your misspellings. Since this is automatic, the first choice
may not be the correct one. Once the word has been corrected, you will
need to reread your work to find it.

I don't know that I am going to write a proper flash sermon on this,
but I can't help thinking about the vineyard in Isaiah 5 and Psalm 80.
They are the assigned texts for the Revised Common Lectionary for
Track 1 Year C.
</p>

<p>
I have read these texts often since I usually review them for John 15
"I am the vine and you are the branches".
</p>

<p>
One of the things that continues to surprise me while reading the
parable in Isaiah 5 is the violence of God's actions:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>taking away its hedge</li>
<li>making it a wasteland</li>
<li>not providing any rain</li>
</ul>
<p>
In some translations, there is a distinction between grapes and bad
fruit. A better way to think of this  is cultivated grapes and wild
grapes.. Some translations maintain this distinction which is helpful.
</p>

<p>
The plantings, the vines, are identified as the people. Their crop is
not the tasty grapes but the wild grapes of oppression and injustice.
That is what is making God angry.
</p>

<p>
Here God is saying that God created an environment for justice and
freedom. Instead, God finds an environment of injustice and, in some
translations, bloodshed.
</p>

<p>
The parable begins with the writer saying that he or she is singing a
song to his/her beloved. The singer is on the side of justice and
righteousness along with God, but as prophet, he/she is pointing out
the state of the people as God sees them.
</p>

<p>
These chapters we have been reading as part of the lectionary really
point out God's frustration at the people who claim to worship God but
behave counter to God's intentions for humanity.

Nick was so funny at dinnertime. I got out his harness. He went into
the bathroom to get a drink but there wasn't much water in the dish. I
hung his harness and leash on the door and filled up his water bowl,
encouraging him to drink some more. He danced around, not sure what to
do. He went into the bathroom but then came out again. Again I
encouraged him to drink but he started butting my legs with his head.
He seemed to be saying, Let's go, so I put his harness on him and off
we went to park.

I have been trying to read a psalm every day. My Old Testament
professor Dr. Robinson said it would change my life. He said that
twenty years ago (that's a scary thought in and of itself). I've never
succeeded at doing this, but it's never too late to give it a shot. I
would read all the psalms twice through in one year.
</p>

<p>
I've been suggesting we read a psalm at the end of our Bible study on
Thursdays. I don't do it every week, but it turns out one of the
participants doesn't like the psalms. I realized that reading one
every week allows us to work through all 150 psalms over time (three
years or so) without getting bogged down in the book of psalms. That
would make things easier for the participant who doesn't like them.
Someone is marking them off as we go.
</p>

<p>
This is a long introduction to reading Psalm 64. I started at Psalm 61
because that is the psalm we read last Thursday and it seemed to be a
good place to start. The problem of embarking on such a task is that
I've read Psalm 1 a lot and never gotten very far after that.
</p>

<p>
I can't remember ever reading Psalm 64 before. No doubt I have, but
nothing stood out to mean. This morning, however, in the wake of the
terrible shootings at El Paso and Youngstown, I couldn't help thinking of
all those bullets or, as the psalmist put it, arrows. 
</p>

<p>
David is talking about words, not literal weapons, but it doesn't much matter in the
context of the psalm. Behind the bullets were evil words. And evil
words and hatred are at the crux of the problem in this country. It
there weren't so many evil words flying about like arrows, people
shopping on a Saturday morning for school supplies or going out for a
fun-filled evening wouldn't be dead–terrible! Unspeakable evil!
</p>

<p>
I take comfort in verse 8:

Their own tongues shall ruin them.<br>
All who see them will shake their heads.<br><a href="https://worldenglishbible.org">World English Bible</a><br></p>

Picture this. Ronnie, our intrepid heroine, is
sitting in the great library of the wizards in the heart of Magic
City. (I know. I know. These names are not very imaginative and need
changing, but it is the best I can do right now.) Anyway, she is
sitting in the library not because she wants to be there but because
she is compelled to be there. The Tribunal of All Wizards (Is this a
better name?) has sentenced her to serve there for some unspecified
length of time. She goes to the library at the pleasure of the Grand
Mistress of Wizards who doesn't like her to begin with. Ronnie is
fulfilling her sentence for the misuse of magic which caused the death
of her mentor, Grand Master Awk.
</p>

<p>
Although Ronnie is unhappy that she must remain in the Magic Lands for
perhaps the rest of her life, she makes the best of being confined to
the library and her living quarters for most of every day. As
imprisonments go in the inhabited galaxy, it is a very lenient
sentence.
</p>

<p>
The wizards did not come up with this punishment without
reason. Ronnie has shown an aptitude for magic. The wizards hope she
can learn to read and understand the books stored in the library which
they cannot even open. Ronnie thinks their hope in her is
misplaced. Even if she can open a book, why do they think she can read
an ancient script and make sense of it. She does not possess these
skills.
</p>

<p>
Neverthe less, she goes to the library and tries to open every book on
every shelf. There are many thousands of books.
</p>

<p>
Then one day Ronnie lugs a very large volume to the library table by
the window. It has a pleasant view of a garden. She sets the tome
down. What else can she possibly call the book but a tome. It is
dusty. Its binding shows much wear. She wonders just how old this book
is and what sort of a book this is. There are no pictures on the
covers. The script on its binding is beautiful and perhaps contains
grains of precious gems. This is not her expertise either but the
script seems to sparkle.
</p>

<p>
With no expectations at all, she tries to open the book. And it
opens.
</p>

<p>
Ronnie gasps. The librarian, working at his desk across the room,
looks up to see the book open and hurries over.
</p>

<p>
"Can you read it?" he asks rather breathlessly.
</p>

<p>
"Can you see the pictures?" Ronnie asks him.
</p>

<p>
"The page is blank," the librarian responds, puzzled.
</p>

<p>
"No, it is not," Ronnie says. "It is a beautifully done star chart."
</p>

<p>
They stand in silence. Ronnie can see it while the librarian cannot.
</p>

<p>
"A star chart of what?" the librarian finally asks.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," Ronnie says. "I would need a modern star chart and a
way to evaluate procession and drift. I don't recognize any of these
stars, but I am not from around this part of the galactic arm. The
constellations look all wrong to me."
</p>

<p>
"Can you copy the chart?" the librarian asks quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Let's see if I can," Ronnie says.
</p>

<p>
Then she smiles. "If this is a map to treasure, I claim it by virtue
of being able to read the map."
</p>

<p>
The librarian does not see the humor in her claim but hurries away to
get paper and writing implements. He also calls the Grand Mistress and
she comes to hover over Ronnie's shoulder.
</p>

<p>
After Ronnie's crude representation of the beautiful chart and much
discussion, the Tribunal corrects the star chart for this time
period. They show it to Ronnie.
</p>

<p>
"It's Planet X," she says, pointing to a particular
constellation. I've been there."
</p>

<p>
In an earlier unpublished adventure, she and Captain Star Runner visited this
forbidden planet with disastrous results.

Jeroboam II had a 40-year reign. During that time, the country
prospered. Reading through the Book of Amos, it is clear that only
some were doing well. Granted, Amos was from Judah and the Lord
sent him. Setting aside the question of worshiping God outside of
Jerusalem and the synchronistic character of temple worship in Israel,
Amos inveighs against personal excess and unethical business
practices. Israel is rotten at its core, straying far from the
precepts God has prescribed for the people in their interpersonal
relationships and societal responsibilities for the poor and needy.
</p>

<p>
It is astounding that twenty-five years after Jeroboam II's death,
Israel fell to the Assyrians. Assyria forcibly deported many to the
far reaches of its empire, effectively dispersing Israel's people so
that ethnic and religious identity of the people evaporated as they
were absorbed by other cultures and religions. Although the land
remained, Israel and its people were absolutely gone except in
the prophetic imagination.
</p>

<p>
What makes reading Amos so disturbing are the parallels to our own
country and culture. How close to annihilation are we? Could life as
we know it come tumbling down as quickly as it did for the people of
Israel?
</p>

<p>
Who will stand up and prophesy to the people and will anyone believe
God's prophet? Or are we doomed to repeat  the experience of ancient Israel?
