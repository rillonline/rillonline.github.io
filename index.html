Today we learned that our new friend, Hulu, will be leaving us sooner than we expected. Next week she is going off for a several month stint in a medium security prison where the men will drill her on her commands. Nina went there, too.

We also learned that Therman celebrated his birthday with 11 other dogs at the school for the blind on the west coast. Therman was raised to be a guide dog, but he is too easily distracted by other dogs when he was in harness. Therman is both Nina's half brother&#x2013;they have the same father&#x2013;and her cousin since their mothers are sisters. Therman looked very happy with his dog school friends. They were all sporting birthday gear.
