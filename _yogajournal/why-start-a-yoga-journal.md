So why start a yoga journal?

I had never considered doing such a thing until I was going through a long list
of yoga books on [bookshare.org](http://bookshare.org/). There was a
book about journaling your yoga practice.

I read the first chapter.

Now, before I go any farther, I need to confess that I am an awful
journal writer. Nevertheless, I am fascinated by journal writing. Other
people's journals have proved useful to historians--who was the man who
wrote down the price of everything? His diaries have proven invaluable
to people who study every day life. There's May Sarton and Henri Nowen.

 haveGratitude journals are supposed to help you in body, mind and spirit.
 I find them boring and repetitive to write. This probably points to my
 lack of imagination rather than the number of people, places and things
 I am, or should be, grateful for

I think my biggest barrier to journal writing is that books about journal
writing, including *The Artist Way* talk, in such glowing terms, about paper
and pens..

* Choose your journal carefully.
* Smell the paper.
* Feel your hand effortlessly flowing across the page.
* Use colored pens.
* Add photos, clippings. Paste them right in.
* Draw pictures.
* Draw lines to connect your thoughts.
* Scribble.

Well, I can't. I can't see what I am writing. So, I use the dreaded computer.
No shelves of beautiful journals for me!

But back to the question: Why journal?

The thought here is to connect yoga practice, the body, with the rest of me. It
seems an interesting way to get to the whole.

And no, I can't sit on my mat at the end of my class and scribble in my
notebook. I suppose I could mutter into my phone or even my watch. I'm not sure
I'm ready for that. I can go home and do that. If I can't hold the thought that
long, it may not have been important enough. Or I'll have to figure out to stop
and make a note.
