So why start a yoga journal?

I had never considered doing such a thing until I was going a long list of yoga books on [bookshare.org](http://bookshare.org/). There was a book about journaling your yoga practice.

I read the first chapter.

Now, before I go any farther, I need to confess that I am an awful journal writer. Nevertheless, I am fascinated by journal writing. Other people's journals have proved useful to historians--who was the man who wrote down the price of everything? His diaries have proven invaluable to people who study every day life. There's May Sarton and Henri Nowen.

 haveGratitude journals are supposed to help you in body, mind and spirit.  I find them boring and repetitive to write. This probably points to my lack my imagination rather than the number of people, places and things I am, or should be, grateful for.
