<p>Today is Elwood's 4th birthday. He was sung to last night at church and greeted this morning from St. Luke's Bible study. His birthday gift was unintentional. I changed clothes quickly last night before church and dropped them on the floor. Elwood found jeans and a sweatshirt when he came home and curled himself up on them. He was still there this morning. Such love. This was not his style when I first met him.</p>

<p>Not to be daunted, we went out again today and went to the Post Office. This is a very confusing place. It was a former A&amp;P from what I understand. Lots of stations, people, and automatic doors. One difficulty is getting outside again. You have to go to the out for the door to open. Dogs expect to go out the door they came in.</p>
<p>It was leaving the Post office that proved to be a challenge for Elwood--or more to the point, getting back on the sidewalk. He made a grand tour of the parking lot and we had a nice chat with a man from Australia from his accent back at the Post office. Eventually, we got back on track and went off to the library to return a book and pick up another book. We has some miscommunication about what a clear sidewalk is and about ice and not going into the street. I tend to be unreasonable if I think there is a possibility about going out into the street and Elwood maintains that icy sidewalks are not what he considers suitable for walking. I try to make up for my dis stress by congratulating him on all good work just as enthusiastically as I fussed about staying on the sidewalk. There is one area he likes to tramp through the snow coming back. I don't know what he is avoiding. I of course sink down further in the snow than he does.</p>
<p>Then the fun began. We crossed the street. The angle was a little strange. I wanted to go a particular direction. I think he did not. The GPS advised we were going in a direction I did not want to go and I figured Elwood did want to go. I turned around and we wandered. Eventually, I figured out we had recrossed the street and may have been walking on the bike path. Then again, we may have been walking on the side of the street. I will give Elwood the benefit of the doubt here though we did not cross a snow bank to get across the street eventually. The cool part was that the GPS could tell me how far I was from our corner. I kept pressing the button and eventually we were approaching it. I suggested right and Elwood turned appropriately. The challenge then became crossing safely. It was windy. I had on a hood. I knew we were in the right place not only because of the GPS but by a car which turned. I'm sure Elwood knew exactly where the crosswalk was. Some cars passed and then it was our turn. Zip. And zip all the way home. Elwood was glad to get back.</p>
<p>I did not mention in a previous post that we also managed to get locked out New Year's Day. I buzzed a neighbor. I didn't realize I was on the wrong row of buttons and buzzed someone on the other side of the building. She was nice enough not only to let me in but to step outside her door to see if I had indeed come inside.</p>

<p>Happy New Year to everyone!</p>
<p>I haven't posted for a while. Life is like that.</p>
<p>The kids were here Christmas Eve. We went to church together. Brian thought there was a lot of singing. If you wanted a service with lots of singing, this was it. A very good service for people who are not necessarily "into" church or who may think differently than you about church. It had singing, candle lighting, kids and the Christmas story as well as a play about how the Christmas story characters were just ordinary people like us.</p>
<p>The soup was a great success with people taking leftovers home. I decided's ed I need to work a little more on the soup choices. i picked 3 heavy soups and that was way too much in the stomach so a lighter soup choice needs to be found.</p>
<p>It's been very cold here and we've had over 38 inches of snow already. The Sunday before Christmas the wind chill was -35.</p>
<p>With the snow blocking routes and Elwood's creativity, I have found myself in need of help. The women of Madison have come through for me. One woman drove me to the library because the path I was on was snow-blocked. Another woman stopped her car to re-direct us as we were in no man's land along the side of a major road. She made sure we knew where we were before returning to her car.</p>
<p>It is very cold today but lots of people were out, especially on the bike path. I heard someone say,"We have 5 miles to go." I don't know if there was a New Year's walk in progress.</p>
<p>I now have GPS. Sited people can have GPS for under $100. I got GPS for under $1000. It is a dedicated unit and very simple which is what I wanted. There are cheaper solutions on cell phones, but I (a) bounced someone out of his application by fiddling with his phone and (b) I couldn't imagine myself messing around with commands on a phone at a corner in 4 degree weather like there was outside today. I can find out where I am by pushing one button with my gloves on if necessary.</p>
<p>I recorded our route today and learned I had walked over 2.25 miles. I need to walk more, for Elwood's sake as well as to deal with the weight which is creeping up due to inaction.</p>
<p>Bear in mind, the average snowfall in Madison has been 51 inches though last year they had 100. The head of the meteorology department at UW Madison does not think it will be 100 this year, but with 40 inches or so on the ground already who knows.</p>
