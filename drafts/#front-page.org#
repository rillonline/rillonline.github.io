* About Rill Online
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: about-rill-online
:END:
rillonline is my [[https://github.com/rillonline/][github]] presence.
Here I collect all my writing including a blog.

Because my blog has fifteen years or so of content, I decided to collect
those posts in separate files and organize them into a project I call
[[https://rillonline.github.io/writing][writing]]. As time goes on, my
blog posts will migrate here. This is an ongoing migration so
[[https://rillonline.github.io/writing][writing]] will continue to have
more old content available.

I am also working on a collection of novels I wrote, primarily for
[[https://nanowrimo.org/][nanowrimo]]. More about that later.

*Happy reading!*

Peace.
