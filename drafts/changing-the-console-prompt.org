This is quite useful if you're using multiple consoles and can't remember which one you are in.

To put the number of your current tty in the command prompt:

Edit .bashrc

Add this line just above the line that starts with 'PS1':

temp=$(tty)


And change the line which starts with 'PS1' to read:

PS1='[${temp:5} \u@\h \W]\$ '

It is the ${temp:5} bit that's different here, after the opening square bracket.

Note that you might have to chown and chgrp the .bashrc file to 'rill' and 'users' because it's wrong in the current image version.

Type this to see the new prompt:

source .bashrc

My prompt now looks like this (for tty1):

[tty1 user@arch-pi ~]$
