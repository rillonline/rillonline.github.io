** TRANSFIGURATION: A POEM
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: transfiguration-a-poem
:END:
From the light of the star the wise ones followed to the brilliance of
Transfiguration--\\
From Jordan's depths, baptismal waters flowing, to soaring peak of
Hermon, divine cloud hovering--\\
From Advent's darkness, Christ's light overcoming, to Transfiguration's
clarity, God's chosen shining--\\
From Galilee to Jerusalem, Christ's face set like flint, Jesus' exodus
beginning, the way of the cross Christ's glory.\\
Transfigured before you today, Christ's sovereignty brightly showing.
"Listen to my Child, my chosen. this one alone is holy."
