IÂ am already being poured out as a libation, and 
the time of my departure has come. 
I have fought the good fight, 
I have finished the race, 
I have kept the faith. From now on 
there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness, which 
the Lord, the righteous judge, will give me on that day, and not only
to me but also 
to all who have longed for his appearing. At my first defense 
no one came to my support, but 
all deserted me. 
May it not be counted against them! But 
the Lord stood by me and 
gave me strength, so that through me 
the message might be fully proclaimed and 
all the Gentiles might hear it. So 
I was rescued from the lion's mouth. 
The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and 
save me for his heavenly kingdom. 
To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.

The Pharisee does not believe he needs rescuing or saving while the
tax collector does.

Paul and Timothy staying up late, talking, praying, singing.

1. The writer has faced persecution for his preaching and teaching.
2. He loves Timothy.

Scholars think this is not the historical Paul and Timothy. Perhaps
they saw themselves as carrying on the tradition of Paul and Timothy.
Perhaps these were their real names and they played off of this
situation.
