Text: 2 Timothy 4:6-8, 16-18

In the name of Jesus. Amen.

I am one of the two readers of Scripture at our Wednesday night Taize
service. The Chapel of
Saint Michael and All Angels is  a small room. I
sit in one of the corners away from the door. Now that the sun is
setting early, only candlelight illuminates the room. It's handy to
read Braille.

Last Wednesday night I was reading First Corinthians 15:1-11 in honor
of Saint James the Just, one of Jesus' brothers who took over the
leadership of the Jerusalem church some time after Jesus' Ascension.

As I previewed the text, I felt Paul's passion, his precise and
compelling account of both the Gospel and how it was transmitted, how
each person or group received the good news that Jesus is risen and
how it really doesn't matter who told you, only that someone told you
about Jesus and you now trust in him.

Reading Scripture aloud during worship is a special experience. God's Word is just not written on the page. It is alive. God is not
speaking long ago in a place far far away. God is speaking here and
now to the people listening.

Conscious of this, I think about speaking God's Word to the people
gathered in the chapel. The long ago of Paul writing to the
Corinthians becomes the now of me speaking to the people in the room.

God's Word in the chapel is for that evening in the same way the lessons and
Gospel you heard are for today.

As I spoke Saint Paul's words became my words. The Corinthians faded
away and the words on my display were addressed to the people sitting
with me.

For I handed on to you as of first importance what I in turn had
received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the
scriptures, and that he was buried, and that he was raised on the
third day in accordance with the scriptures -- 1 Cor 15:3-4

My experience reminded me of a line from Wallace Stevens' poem "The House Was Quiet and the World Was Calm":

In the same way the messenger becomes the message.

The third generation Christian evangelist and author of this letter so
identifies with the Apostle Paul that he has taken up his mantle and
calls his young protege, Timothy. I imagine Paul and Timothy talking late into
the night, growing deeper into their relationship as teacher and
student. Like the apostle, Paul continues his counsel and
encouragement in his letters.

What comes through to us is his ardent faith, his fervor for
ministry, his love for Timothy and his unshakable witness to Jesus. 

- Yes, he has fought the good fight.
- Yes, he has run the race.
- Yes, he has kept the faith.
- Yes, he has set a high bar for all Christians who come after him like each one of you.

But in doing so, he has also shared his complete trust in Jesus. I'm
certain Timothy heard the story many times before, but Paul tells him
one last time:

At my first defense, (Surely there were others), at my first defense
no one stood by me, but the Lord Jesus stood by me. The Lord Jesus
rescued me from conviction and death. The Lord Jesus rescued me from
all subsequent evil attacks so
that I would be saved for His heavenly kingdom. This doesn't mean
my life and work were easy. I just know the Lord Jesus always stands
with me.   

Paul's testimony rings down the millennia all the way to you and so the messenger becomes the message.

Many others have taken up his mantle. We know some of their names.
Many are anonymous, their names and words, their selfless deeds have
gone unrecorded and forgotten.

God's Word has been spoken in your midst.
Jesus' words and deeds of power have been remembered and retold in your
midst. Paul has provided his testimony.

Now it is your turn. You are Jesus' messengers. You are the message of Good News of
Jesus Christ, the one who rescues and saves all who trust in Him, right here, right now.
The world needs your message. Every person you meet needs you to be
Jesus' message to them. Amen.
