<h3 id="sec-1-1">The Directory Editor</h3>

Emacs lets me have a directory view of my home folder.
 M-x dired
I am prompted for a path. If I start typing a directory name, I can use tab to complete it. Then I press return.
I am now in a buffer with a list of files and directories. I can use the menus and some special letters to manipulate my folders and files.
I wanted to delete a directory and its sub-directories. I typed a capital d "D" on the line of the buffer where the directory name and details was displayed. Immediately I was prompted to confirm the deletion. Then, because the directory was not empty, I was prompted whether I wanted my deletions to be recursive. Again I confirmed and voila. Everything was deleted.
I can also rename, encrypt and decrypt entries and do other wonderful things.

<p>
I can also make new folders by using
</p>
: M-x make-directory RET
<p>
I am prompted for a directory name. I use the path so the directory is created in the right place. For example:
</p>
: ~/org/blog-files
<p>
I press RET and my directory is created. It certainly beats getting out of emacspeak to do it from the command line.

<h3 id="sec-1-3">Switching Between Buffers</h3>
div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
When I'm doing any kind of writing in emacs, I often want to have several buffers open and switch between them. This is easily done.  I press
</p>
: C-x b
<p>
The name of my previous buffer is displayed.  If this is the buffer I want, I press RET; otherwise I can scroll down through a list of buffers to find the right one.  I find this quicker than pressing
</p>
: C-x C-b
<p>
to get a list of buffers and scrolling until I find the one I want. With
</p>
: C-x b
<p>
I can quickly switch back and forth between two buffers.
