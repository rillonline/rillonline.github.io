In the name of Jesus. Amen.

Have you ever thought of Jesus as a stand-up comic?

Here is how Wikipedia defines stand-up comedy:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
a comic style in which a comedian performs in front
of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them. ... the
comedian gives the illusion that they are dialoguing, but in actuality, they are monologuing a grouping of humorous stories,
jokes and one-liners, typically called a shtick, routine, or set.
#+END_QUOTE

- Live audience? Jesus has that.
- monolog? Sometimes. Sometimes its a dialog or a conversation with
  the disciples. I'll give Jesus this one, too.
- Humorous stories, jokes and one-liners? Today's parable is quite funny.
  I'll show you why.

Jesus signals the crowd what sort of a story this will be.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
“Take care! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of possessions.” (V. 15)
#+END_QUOTE

- The crowd is now alert.
- When Jesus begins the parable with the words, “The land of a rich   man produced abundantly," (v. 16), the crowd knows what this story will be about:

- greed
- abundance
- possessions
- the land of a rich man

This is going to be good. What is going to happen to the land of the
rich man? Remember that many in the crowd have lost their family farms
to rich landowners.

- The rich man gets richer. This is definitely going to be good. The
  richer they are, the farther they will fall.
- He has this conversation with himself and uses the very improbable
  word "soul". Do you talk to yourself like that? Maybe that's the
  silly way rich people talk to themselves.
- Then the rich man builds bigger and better barns. He is not taking care. He is not on guard.
- Then God shows up in person. Utto.
- And then God calls the rich man a fool. And not just any sort of
  fool. The word here means "senseless", like a statue is a senseless
  person. The rich man is a fake person, a person who is dumb as a
  rock.

  Imagine it. A rich person incapable of thought like a rock. He thought he was so smart building all those barns and keeping all those crops for himself so he could sit on his hands and do nothing at all for years and years.

- And then the denouement. The rich man is going to die and not get
  even a single day to enjoy his wealth.

Ha! Ha! Ha! Don't you just love it when the selfish and proud-hearted get theirs!

This is what God's justice looks like. Yay for God.  

Mary sang a song (and so did you during Advent),

#+BEGIN_VERSE
I proclaim the power of God,
you do marvels for your servants;
though you scatter the proud-hearted
and destroy the might of princes.
And holy is your name 
through all generations!
Everlasting is your mercy 
to the people you have chosen,
and holy is your name.
David Haas "Holy Is Your Name"

This is what the Kingdom of God looks like.

On the way to the cross, Jesus shows you what he means by being rich toward God

- Concerning greed: the parable of the Good Samaritan. You are never too important  to help another with your time or money--not all your
  money. The Samaritan gave the innkeeper some and then went on his way, promising to settle up with him when he returned.
- Concerning abundance. The story of Mary and Martha. You are never too busy, too
  rushed, too tired, too distracted to spend time with Jesus.
- Concerning possessions. This parable. Don't keep more than you need to
  yourself. Share. You have enough. Witness the man arguing with his
  brother about his inheritance. Be satisfied with what you have.

On the way to the cross, Jesus has no time for the treasure of
this world. On the way to the Kingdom of God, neither do you. Amen.
