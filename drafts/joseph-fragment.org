What do we know about him? See if you agree with the following statements:

- He is Mary's husband.
- He is Jesus' earthly father.
- He is a carpenter.
- He was an old man.
- He was a widower with children before he married Mary.
- He died before Jesus began his ministry.

If you agreed with everything on this list, you would be half right.

Our information about Joseph is so sketchy that in the centuries aftero
Jesus' birth legends about Joseph appeared. In Renaissance art Jospeh
appears as both an elderly man and a young one. There are stories
about Jesus as a boy and later how he sat at Joseph's bedside when he
died. Our information is so lacking that it has led one
Episcopal bishop to suggest Joseph is entirely fictional. If you do a
search for the name Joseph in the Gospels in an app, online or in an
old-fashioned paper concordance, you will find that outside of the
infancy narratives, Joseph does not make an appearance. He is not
mentioned at all in Mark and only when Philip calls Jesus "son of
Joseph" in John. The most curious thing of all: Joseph never says a
word. The closest Joseph gets to speaking is that he marvels at
Simeon's words in the temple.
