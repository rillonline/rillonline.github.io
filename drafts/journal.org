Nick and I had our third anniversary together on Friday, August 2. I
need to write a post about this. Some ideas:
- Important events in the last year:
  + Moving
  + Nick's surgery
  + learning our new environment
  + Scarey when Nick seemed unfocused
  + Polar Vortex
  + continuing struggle: when Nick is sad about not going out
  + Nick is inscrutable
  + working with Nick

Funny stories about Nick: elevator, in one door and out the other to
get to park, playing with the football at Pilates, laying down on the
towel at AManda's

Nick was so funny at dinnertime. I got out his harness. He went into
the bathroom to get a drink but there wasn't much water in the dish. I
hung his harness and leash on the door and filled up his water bowl,
encouraging him to drink some more. He danced around, not sure what to
do. He went into the bathroom but then came out again. Again I
encouraged him to drink but he started butting my legs with his head.
He seemed to be saying, Let's go, so I put his harness on him and off
we went to park.<2019-08-05 Mon 17:44>
I had to leave aNew Jersey and not spend much time with my family to
be myself. Moving to Wisconsin, I had to be at a distance. Finally,
moving to Milwaukee I had to be on the south side while my son lives
on the North Shore. It is a self-imposed exile, but an exile which
gives me room. As a child, one of the songs I liked was "don"t Fence
Me In". I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences, gaze at
the moon til I lose my senses, can't look at hobbles and I can't stand
fences. Don't fence me in! <2019-08-18 Sun 20:47>
Susan Neville writes about Lost River in Indiana. A good addition to
Ronnie's story--the Musical Mountains and the Lost River. Also White
River in Indianapolis is not navigable by deep-draft or wide boats but
can be navigated by small craft like rowboats, kayaks and canoes.
Definitely  would work on Marling. Might also be another good choice
for the Lost River.<2019-08-18 Sun 20:51>
I am slowly getting the hang of org agenda. My favorite key is "s"
since it save all open org buffers including all the ones I have
changed through the agenda. I just have to remember not to hit enter.<2019-09-03 Tue 09:42>
