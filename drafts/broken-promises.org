Title: Broken Promises\\
Date: December 22, 2019\\
Text: Matthew 1:18-23

In the name of Jesus. Amen.

I have been thinking a lot about the purpose of Advent and exactly how
to approach this Sunday before Christmas, just a little more than
fifty-six hours away from our celebration of Jesus' birth here at Saint
Luke's. (Father Jason, not to scare you, but that's all the time you
have to be ready.) The Gospel reading gives a very different perspective
on this holy event. There are no sore afraid shepherds--no one is ever
more scared than when they are sore afraid, no angels singing and no
child wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger.

As we have plunged into the ever deepening darkness of Advent, we have
lit more and more candles to drive the gloom of despair and sorrow,
calamity and fear, and the grim reality of broken promises away. For
many Christmas is a season of heartache, not joy.

Into this darkness of many shades of blue steps Joseph, a shadowy figure
himself. Much of what we think we know about Joseph comes from ancient
legend and renaissance art. We know three things about Joseph:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  1. He was a carpenter, that is, he made things like farm tools and
  furniture out of wood. This meant the only things he owned were his
  tools. Destitution was only one job away.

  2. He was Mary's husband.
#+END_QUOTE

3. He declared Jesus to be his own child by giving him the name given to
him by the angel, Jesus, thus giving Jesus legitimacy and a protector.

That's it. Joseph does not appear outside of the infancy narratives in
Matthew 's and Luke's gospels. He is not mentioned in Mark's gospel at
all. In the Gospel of John Philip describes Jesus to Nathanael as "Jesus
son of Joseph from Nazareth.‚Äù (John 1:45b NRSV) That's it. Joseph never
speaks a word. He is so sketchy that one Episcopal bishop has suggested
he isn't even real.

And yet Scripture in its divine wisdom lifts up Joseph as a great model
of faith in action in our darkest hour.

You want to talk reality? Joseph is facing the ultimate broken
promise--Mary's pregnancy. Not knowing what actually happened, Joseph
thinks Mary has been involved with someone else after their engagement.
The marriage contract is broken. Joseph sees no alternative except to go
about the heartbreaking task of nullifying it. But being a righteous
man, being a just man, being a man who does the right thing, he chooses
to go about his distasteful business quietly. He has no wish to shame
Mary publicly. And having decided on his course of action, Joseph is
ready to sleep.

Dreams are funny things. Some of us dream in color. Some of us remember
our dreams while others are barely aware of them at all. Scientists have
given us reasons why the brain finds it necessary to dream. The
Scripture and church tradition report how God works through dreams.

Joseph's dreams are straight forward. The angel speaks and Joseph first
listens and then carries out his instructions faithfully and without
question as strange as they might sound. Joseph abandons his resolution
to end his marital contract. Instead Joseph completes it by marrying
Mary. Joseph completes the angel's instructions by naming Mary's child
Jesus and making the child his own--a complete reversal of how the story
looked to play out at the beginning.

And as the Holy Family's story unfolds through the next chapter,
Joseph's dreams continue. Again and again Joseph puts his faith into
action by carrying out the angel's instructions. He flees from Herod's
bloodthirsty slaughter of the Innocent, bringing the child and his
mother first to Egypt and then, after Herod's death, to Galilee outside
of the reach of Herod's tyrannical son.

the family is settled in Nazareth. Each time we are told that these
actions complete a long ago prophecy, underscoring how ordinary people
like Joseph act through faith in God's promises.

I want you to remember this. Joseph's story begins with a gut-wrenching
broken promise. Biblical people, known and unknown to us, struggle with
their own circumstances and cry out to God to fulfill, to complete God's
own promises.

Today's Psalmist says:

... give us life, that we may call upon your Name.\\
Restore us, O Lord God of hosts;\\
show the light of your countenance, and we shall be saved.\\
Psalm 80:17b-18 BCP

Into the darkness of Advent and deep blue shadows of your distress comes
the light no darkness can overcome--Immanuel--God with us. You are never
alone. Jesus always, always, is with you. That's a promise Jesus always
keeps. You can have faith in this. Look! The Savior is in our midst.
Amen.
