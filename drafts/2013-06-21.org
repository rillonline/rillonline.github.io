#+SETUPFILE:   ~/org/setupfile-html.org
**  Disaster!
There is a warning near the top of the .emacs initialization file
which says "If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be
careful."  My assumption was that I'd break something and then need to
correct the .emacs file. **Wrong**.  I miscoded the url for the
org-mode repository and crashed emacspeak. Fixing the .emacs file did
no good at all. Emacspeak was silent. Using Speakup to read the
*messages* buffer and discovered the unfixable error.
What to do?
Mike had a vanilla copy of the emacs directories in the home folder. I
renamed my old directories and decompressed the tar ball and voila. I
have a happy emacspeak again.
##  Protecting Against Such Mistakes
Save your working files. Save them like this:
#+BEGIN-EXAMPLE
tar -cjvf emacspeak.tbz emacspeak/ .emacs.d/

#+END-EXAMPLE
To extract the files in the .tbz file when needed, do this
#+BEGIN-EXAMPLE
tar -xjvf emacspeak.tbz
#+END-EXAMPLE
Of course you can modify the filename if desired but keep the
extension .tbz.
