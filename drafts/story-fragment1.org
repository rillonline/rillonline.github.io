, but first let's talk about pigs.

The story about pigs is told about Jesus. Maybe Jesus told it to the
crowds after it happened. We heard it several weeks ago. You remember
... A man is living in a cave because he is possessed by a lot of
demons. In fact, they call themselves legion (Remember this word.) and
beg to be sent into a herd of pigs. Jesus obliges. The herd of pigs
run down the bank of the lake and jump in. They drown.

We say, "Oh, those poor pigs!" A contemporary audience would be
rolling on the ground laughing. Picture it. A Roman legion marching
down the roads of Galilee in perfect precision. I don't think it's a
stretch to imagine the locals called them pigs. The Romans ate pigs
unlike the Jewish people. So here we have the legion running all
piggley-wiggley down the bank and drowning in the lake because the
demons went into them. Ha! Ha! Ha! That piggy Roman legion got theirs.
Wouldn't that be a glorious day
