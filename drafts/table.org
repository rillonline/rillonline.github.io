Session 1: Develop a Story Idea You’re Passionate About 4Session 1: Develop a Story Idea You’re Passionate About(That will take you all the way to 50,000 words)Get started with: 4 Ways to Develop an Idea1.Borrow a Plot: First, write a summary of 3 books or movies or stories you love. Includeimportant characters, major plot turns, and setting. Here’s an example:Example: A teenage girl lives in a dystopian world where the USA has been divided into 13 Districts, and every year children are chosen from each district to fight to the death. The teenage girl volunteers to fight in place of her sister. She tries to survive while also protesting against the evil Capital and (maybe) falling in love. (Hunger Games).Write 3 summaries:
Session 1: Develop a Story Idea You’re Passionate About 5Then, choose one of the summaries and start changing around different parts - characters, setting, plot turns, adjectives, verbs, anything else you like! See where those changes take you, and keep writing when you get inspired. Here’s an example:Example: A teenage girl lives in a future where the oceans have risen and everyone lives on small islands. The water is controlled by pirates who demand a sacrifice each year to keep the island safe. The girl is chosen, but in a storm, she’s rescued by a different kind of pirate ship - one made up of former would-be sacrifices who act as pirates against the pirates. And...Okay, so that idea isn’t done yet, but I’m already super into it.   Also, dibs on that idea. I’m writing it for NaNoWriMo because I liked it so much. You can look for it in hardback in 2021.Change around the elements of one or all of your summaries:
Session 1: Develop a Story Idea You’re Passionate About 62.Borrow a Character: Invent a history or future for someone.Maybe it’s a friend you losttouch with after college, a teacher you had, a family member you’ve heard stories about, or justsomeone you’ve seen in photos or on the bus. I’d like to write a novel starring my great-grandmother someday, inspired by the pictures I’ve seen of her (I’ve never really heard anythingabout her!).Who is the person that intrigues you? What was their childhood like? What did they dream of? What was their greatest desire? What obstacles did they face? What was their greatest triumph?Finally (since most novels aren’t someone’s entire life story), you have to find the story. What part of that imagined life has the most drama, the most ups and downs? A moment of adventure or possibility or danger, when things changed? Remember, you’re INVENTING this person, so feel free to go wild.3.News You Can Use: Pick an event from the news. Imagine it from the perspective of differentpeople involved with it. So a story about a river flooding might include the single mother drivingher two kids on a camping trip, the park ranger called in to help, the farmer who lives down theroad. Feel free to use the basics of the news story for inspiration, but make up your owndetails—change the place, the time, the specifics of the people involved (age, gender identity,personality).
Session 1: Develop a Story Idea You’re Passionate About 7What news stories have stuck with you? What kind of people might be involved? What are their lives like?

Session 2: Create Complex, Believable Characters9Session 2: Create Complex, Believable Characters (Strong enough to shoulder a novel and keep your interest)Get started with: Character Development and Questionnaires (adapted from the Young Novelist Workbook)Most people think that an intriguing plot is what makes a story good, but the truth is that exciting plots are made up of original and well-developed characters.Flat Characters vs. Original CharactersNot only are characters with hidden depths and secrets more fun to read about, they're also more fun to write about. Though you'll end up writing about a bunch of different people in your novel next month, most of them will fall into one of three categories: The protagonist, the supporting characters, and the antagonist.The ProtagonistThe protagonist is the character with the starring role in your book. In most novels, the protagonist is on a journey to get what they want more than anything else in the world, whether it's fame, revenge, reuniting with a long-lost sibling, or something much more elusive, like overcoming poverty or cancer.The Supporting Characters Supporting characters are characters in a novel that have an important role in your protagonist’slife. Some may be around for the protagonist’s entire journey, some for only part. Supporting characters can be friends, close relatives, love interests, you name it. These characters also have dreams of their own, and their adventures will add even more excitement to your novel.The Physical AntagonistA physical antagonist is a living, breathing character in a novel that is standing in the way of the protagonist achieving their goal. This does not mean that all physical antagonists are evil monsters. Some antagonists stand in the way simply through jealousy, or misunderstanding, or by having a set of goals that differs from that of the protagonist’s.Flat character:Steve was a good kid. He got good grades and was never late to class.A better-developed character: Steve Goodhold was a good kid. He got good grades and was never late to class. Little did everyone know that he spent his nights working as an internet hacker for a modern Mafioso who he met through his older cousin, Peter.Steve didn’t need much sleep, which was a good thing. He slept maybe two hours a night, and spent the rest of his time stealing identities, wiring funds, and making more money than both his parents combined. He told himself he was saving for college, but the thrill of his secret life of crime was steadily eroding his interest in an Ivy League education.
Session 2: Create Complex, Believable Characters10If Fernando is your protagonist and he wants to recruit Jill for his dance crew, but Greg asked her first, this doesn't mean Greg is a “bad guy.” He's just another guy who admires the same kind of pop-and-lock style.Then again, there are those antagonists that are just plain evil. It's up to you to decide who's going to stand in your protagonist's way, and how they are going to do it.  ORThe Abstract AntagonistThough a lot of antagonists are living, breathing beings, some are not. Some protagonists face off against illness, or grief, or the powers of a corrupt government. We like to call these kinds of antagonists abstract antagonists because they don't take actual physical form. If your novel’s antagonist is not a living person/animal/entity, you have an abstract antagonist.It may be easier think of it this way: if your protagonist cannot physically kick your antagonist in the knee, it's probably abstract.It's a great idea for you, the author, to try and get to know your characters before you begin writing. Enter the character questionnaire!Physical AntagonistAbstract AntagonistA racist or intolerant characterRacism/intolerance in a community or in generalA character who is working to make sure your protagonist lives a poverty-stricken lifePoverty or the economy in a community or in generalA character who is forcing your character to struggle against nature (e.g. someone who has left your character stranded in Antarctica)Nature as an entity (e.g. a natural disaster or an extreme climate)A character whose beliefs oppress your protagonistA belief system, religion, or the concept of eitherA government official such as a dictator who has it in for your protagonistA corrupt governmentYour protagonist's evil bossA corporation/companyA character whose sole mission is to make sure your protagonist becomes ill (e.g. though poisoning or exposure to a deadly disease)Disease/illness in general
