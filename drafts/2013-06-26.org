###  Three Handy Tips
These are from Mike.
1.  For the meta key, use escape.
  The meta key can be either the Alt key or the escape key. I've been using the alt key. But if I use the escape key, I find it faster and easier to type. In addition, I can use the key combination 
  :  M-left-arrow or M-right-arrow
  in certain applications and not end up in a different console.
2.  Speaking of consoles, Mike and I both use different voices so we know where we are. By default, and we don't know how to change this yet, emacspeak uses a male voice. Each of us use a female voice in the console. We can distinguish where we are by voice alone.
3.  I don't do a lot of console work these days, having my head inside emacspeak. But if I did use multiple console sessions, this would be very handy.
