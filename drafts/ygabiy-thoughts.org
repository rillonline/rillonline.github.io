I've been reading Elizabeth Sims's book /You've Got a Book in You/. It's
about writing, of course. I always get suckered into self-help books and
then remember I don't like self-help books. They always talk about your
problems and the author's solution to your problem. If solving problems
was as easy as reading a book, there would be no problems in the world.
The problem these books are solving is the authors' need for money.

Nevertheless, there are some good ideas in this book. Writing is not a
problem, according to Sims. Writing is easy. Easy for her to say. She
has experience. She knows people. She is talking with this friend or
that. She suggests drawing your characters. And, of course, she is
inamored by colored pens and papers.

I've found some good suggestions for creating characters. It's a simpler
list than the questionnaire I've been working on. I'll use it for other
characters. By working through some of her chapters today, I'm working
out the opening to my novel. It will be much longer than I thought and
things are starting to fall into place. I'm wondering how writing this
book will be since so much is clear to me now. Of course, the part that
is clear is only the first quarter or third of the book so there will be
lots of opportunity for pantsing. Smile.
