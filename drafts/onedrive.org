I use OneDrive to store files in the cloud. I have the app on my PC,
MacBook, iPhone and iPad. I wanted it on my Linux machine as well.

It is possible to upload and download files from the web, but the
website is not too screen reader friendly.

Ubuntu has an app called, not surprisingly, =onedrive=. Install it in
the usual way.

#+begin_example
sudo apt install onedrive
#+end_example

You will need access to a graphical browser to complete the
installation.

Run the app.

#+begin_example
onedrive
#+end_example

You will be prompted to copy a very long link to authorize use of the
app and a prompt to paste a uri to indicate you have given permission
for Microsoft to allow the upload and download of files as well as
deletions.

*Note*: If you have previously authorized =onedri= and, for whatever
reason, need to reinstall the app, you need to remove the authorization
from =live.com=. Otherwise, the provided link will not load properly for
authorization.

Copy the web address in the address bar and paste it into the prompt.

Once this is done, you can run =onedrive=.

#+begin_example
onedrive --synchronize
#+end_example

This will create a directory in your home directory called =OneDrive=.
Note that the 'o' and 'd' are capitalized.

All your OneDrive files will be downloaded in their respective
directories.

=onedrive= has the ability to limit the directories which are synched
and to upload or download files only.

#+begin_example
onedrive --synchronize --upload-only
onedrive --synchronize --download-only
#+end_example

=onedrive= can monitor =OneDrive= for changes and immediately update
your instance.

There are other options you can explore. These are ones I use.

I have decided that my Linux machine is my "source of truth" for
OneDrive. The command I use now is:

#+begin_example
    onedrive --synchronize --local-first
#+end_example
