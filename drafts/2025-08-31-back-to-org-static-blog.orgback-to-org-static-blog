My github pages are a mess. There are a combination of Jekyll and Nikola configurations so I was looking for something simple to work with.

I found ~org-static-blog~ which is fairly straight forward. (More on that in a later note.) It wasn't doing exactly what I wanted to do so I switched to ~org-publish~.

And that's where the trouble began. I googled and used AI and had a fairly good set up, but curiously, the posts are sorted by time stamp rather than ~#+date~. I thought the AI gurus could help me fix this by writing code to sort my notes by their dates rather than by their time stamps. **I was wrong**!

Oh, they wrote code. They fixed the code. They added more code. They criticized existing code. With each query, they had more analysis and more tweaks.

But nothing worked. I continued to have the same error. My files could not be sorted.

So I'm back to ~org-static-blog~ which may not be perfect, but at least works!
