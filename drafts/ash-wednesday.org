ASH WEDNESDAY February 5, 2002

You are dust and to dust you shall return. Sinners come to kneel
anonymously. Ashes from Palm Sunday branches burned. You are dust and to
dust you shall return. God signs faces with love for all to learn. The
mark in ash the resurrection key. You are dust and to dust you shall
return. Sinners come to kneel anonymously.
