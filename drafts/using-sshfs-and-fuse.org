​## Using sshfs and fuse to mount a Linux file-system on another Linux
host

Here's how to use sshfs and fuse to mount/unmount one Linux file-system
on another Linux host.

Arch:

#+begin_example
sudo pacman -S sshfs fuse --noprogress --needed
#+end_example

Raspbian:

#+begin_example
sudo apt-get install sshfs fuse
#+end_example

(I think fuse is already installed in stock Raspbian).

How to mount a filesystem

#+begin_example
sshfs hostname: mountpoint
#+end_example

Note, that it's recommended to run it as user, not as root. And note the
space between the colon and the mount-point.

For this to work the mountpoint must be owned by the user.

If the username is different on the host you are connecting to, then use
the "username@host:" form.  If you need to enter a password sshfs will
ask for it (actually it just runs ssh which ask for the password if
needed).

You can also specify a directory after the ":".  The default is the home
directory.

To unmount the filesystem:

#+begin_example
fusermount -u mountpoint
#+end_example
