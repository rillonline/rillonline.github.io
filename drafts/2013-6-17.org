***  Modifying the .emacs File
I learned how to eliminate the splash screen today. Add the following line to your .emacs file:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 (setq inhibit-splash-screen t)
#+END_EXAMPLE
**Remember**:
+  Add this line after emacspeak settings. The emacspeak settings won't work if this line appears before them.
+  Put a space in front of the line.
+  You can turn the splash screen back on by changing 't' to 'nil'.
