After Roop and Awk are killed, Vesha tells Ronnie that Vesha will take over the project which is bad news since now Ronnie knows Vesha is a traitor. Vesha also tells Ronnie that the merchant ship is in port and that Ronnie will be sent back to the Director in disgrace and with a recommendation for court marshall. Leaving the MAgic Lands was what Ronnie wanted, but now is the last thing she wants. Instead, she contrives to send a message and to stay in order to stop Vesha.
