   3. River Walk. Ronnie and Tripp decide to go out for the evening. They
      go down to the riverside. Amid the lights and music, Ronnie learns
      about the deprivation of the people and the great disparity between
      the haves and the have nots. Ronnie asks Tripp is she is from this
      planet. Tripp says no. She and Senior Master Gaunt are from Marling,
      another planet in The Magic Lands which is very agricultural and very
      underdeveloped. Both apprentices are puzzled by the state of this
      planet.

   4. The fracas. Ronnie and Tripp are challenged by some locals because
      they are dressed in apprentice attire. The women are uncertain how to
      respond since they thought their position as apprentices would be
      respected, this being a planet in The Magic Lands. Apparently not.
      Ronnie prepares for a fight and is assessing how best to handle her
      attackers when Senior Master Gaunt shows up and rescues them. Tripp
      summoned him. Ronnie is annoyed rather than relieved. She is
      accustomed to taking care of herself. The women are scolded by Senior
      Master Gaunt for associating with the locals. Tripp accepts this
      scolding but Ronnie is outraged. She complains to Grand MAster Awk
      who does not give her an explanation which outrages her even more. In
      the morning, they resume their journey aboard a different hovercraft.
