<h3>Modifying the .emacs File</h3>
<p>I learned how to eliminate the splash screen today. Add the following line to your .emacs file:
</p>


<pre class="example">(setq inhibit-splash-screen t)
</pre>

<p>
<strong>Remember</strong>:
</p><ul>
<li>Add this line after emacspeak settings. The emacspeak settings won't work if this line appears before them.
</li>
<li>Put a space in front of the line.
</li>
<li>You can turn the splash screen back on by changing 't' to 'nil'. 
</li>
</ul>
