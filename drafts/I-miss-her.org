** I miss her
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: i-miss-her
:END:
In the daily tasks, in the ordinary doing of things, I miss her.
25minutes to an appointment-- I will take her out. There is time for
that. And then, I miss her. I will sit in my chair. She will come to be
petted, to ask for a biscuit. And then, I miss her. I lay down in bed at
night and listen for her breathing by the foot of the bed. And then, I
miss her. I awake in the morning and check the time. I will dress and
take her out. And then, I miss her. Her water bowl is no longer on the
floor under the dishwasher door when I load and unload. And then, I miss
her.
