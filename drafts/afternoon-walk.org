** Afternoon Walk
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: afternoon-walk
:END:
A wintry taste of splattered rain against my nose.\\
A skittering pebble crosses our path ahead.\\
An ocean roar of traffic ebbs away\\
All sense of place and time so that alone\\
We circumnavigate an empty world.\\
In windy solitude we travel sure\\
Through colorless environs gray and white and dull\\
Until we reach that holy spot and shut\\
The door to hold that lonely world at bay,\\
And find the warmth and color we had lacked.\\
When walking round the autumn world outdoors.
