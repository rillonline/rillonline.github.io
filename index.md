# Hey there ðŸ‘‹#

*A little bit about me:*

-  a writer,

-  a user of accessible software

-  an avid reader and podcast listener

# About Rill Online #

rillonline is my [github][rillonline] presence.
Here I collect all my writing including a blog.

Because my blog has fifteen years or so of content, I decided to
collect those posts in separate files and organize them into a project
I call [writing][writing]. As time goes
on, my blog posts will migrate here. This is an ongoing migration so
[writing][writing] will continue to have more old content available.

I am also working on a collection of novels I wrote, primarily for
[nanowrimo][nanowrimo]. More about that later.

**Happy reading!**

Peace.
