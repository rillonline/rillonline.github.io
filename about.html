<h2>title: About this blog</h2>

<p>This blog is a repository for my writing, technical notes and my personal diary -- more expansive than Facebook and  almost as quick.</p>

<h3>About the Author</h3>

<p>Call me Rill. I enjoy writing, fiddling with computers and sharing my adventures with my guide dog.</p>
