<p>
Today we learned that our new friend, Hulu, will be leaving us sooner than we expected. Next week she is going off for a several month stint in a medium security prison where the men will drill her on her commands. Nina went there, too.
</p>

<p>
We also learned that Therman celebrated his birthday with 11 other dogs at the school for the blind on the west coast. Therman was raised to be a guide dog, but he is too easily distracted by other dogs when he was in harness. Therman is both Nina's half brother&#x2013;they have the same father&#x2013;and her cousin since their mothers are sisters. Therman looked very happy with his dog school friends. They were all sporting birthday gear.

<p>
We met Hulu today.  Nina and I got off the bus and went to the car. Hulu was waiting in the passenger footwell. Nina got into the back. Immediately Nina and Hulu met each other over the console. It took Sara and I a little bit to get both girls settled in their respective places.
</p>

<p>
We drove to the coffee shop. Although the temps were in the 50s, we sat outside by the fire pit. It was too noisy inside. The dogs behaved themselves though Hulu needed a lot of encouragement to be still. She is still learning.
</p>

<p>
When we went back to the house, the dogs had fun playing. Lots of roughhousing.
</p>

<p>
We will visit again soon.

<p>
I am looking forward to meeting Hulu. She is a five-month black Lab who is in training to become a guide dog. I am certain Nina will have fun playing with her.
